years, i can say that the authors too often lack a sense of film as a medium: the dance is there, but the film is not. it is forgotten that time, space, characters and what surrounds and creates them function differently on film than on stage.\n\nthe second problematic area is the clumsy integration of choreography into the world of film, which causes the language of dance on film to seem unjustified and not communicative enough. in those instances, dance does not say much and the reason a body moves a specific way remains uncertain.\n\nin the films that have been selected this year, the authors have created comprehensive worlds, despite the intricacy of the genre, and dance (in some cases movement as a whole) is a natural part of those worlds. these films are great examples of how space and a dancing body can form an eloquent whole, which in turn creates a spacious and voluminous world.\n\narolin raudva\n\nchoreographer-dancer\n\nfestival programmer for dance films\n\n

was our job to plough that field until it could be truly harvested one day!”\n\nestonian animation union has an honor to present the creations of the founders of estonian animation that belong to the world classics to an eager audience, hungry for inspiration and defining the present day. this programme starts off with little johnny’s mysterious journey to explore the temporal dimension of the world and the processes that help us find the essence of being human and the source of our power. the punch-line of the unique collection that forms the pillars of estonian animation is the present

common preoccupation for prager as she recontextualizes the tropes of classical hollywood movies and uncovers the darkness that lies underneath the shiny surface of glitz and glamour.\n\n“follow the

audiences and observation. with a title taken from one of the classics of hollywood cinema, the selection helps us see the paths that lead towards prager’s work and the roads that venture away from it.\n\nplay utilises found footage as we observe audiences in theatre auditoriums, concert halls and cinemas. as we see them applaud, we begin to question who actually is the viewer in this scenario.

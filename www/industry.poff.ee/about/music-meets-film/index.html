The title <em>Even if I lose everything</em> refers to an entry in Arvo Pärt’s musical notebooks, which the composer pages through in the film. The musings and recollections inspired by the notes in these journals, in parallel with domestic scenes, shed light on the composer’s life and creative philosophy, painting a personal, in-depth picture of Arvo Pärt. The film was produced by the Minor Film studio in collaboration with the Arvo Pärt Centre, UE and ECM Records and its soundtrack includes excerpts from Pärt’s works.</p><ul><li><strong>19.15 Trip back to Tallinn, Nordic Hotel Forum</strong></li></ul><h4>2018 Photos</h4><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/poffihunt/albums/72157673840866107">23.11.2018 Industry@Tallinn: Music Meets Films Masterclasses @EMTA</a></p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/poffihunt/albums/72157700687833192">23.11.2018 Industry@Tallinn: Music meets film</a></p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/poffihunt/albums/72157703894759104">24.11.18 Industry@Tallinn: Music Meets Film</a></p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/poffihunt/albums/72157703948332735">24.11.2018 Industry@Tallinn “Music Meets Film&quot;</a></p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/poffihunt/albums/72157698108430780">25.11.18 Industry@Tallinn Music Meets Film, Arvo Pärt Centre</a></p></section><section class="article_extra"></section></section><section class="team"><h1 class="sub_section_headline">Meet</h1><div class="sub_team"><div class="person"><div class="person_head"><a href="/alan-davey"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Alan_Davey_Svea_Ideon_08023871d9.jpg" alt="Alan  Davey"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Alan Davey</h4><p><span>Speaker, Music Meets Film</span></p></div></a></div></div><div class="person"><div class="person_head"><a href="/gavin-greenaw"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Gavin_Greenaway_Dita_Vollmond_1098_Svea_Ideon_a4514de472.jpg" alt="Gavin  Greenaway "><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Gavin Greenaway</h4><p><span>Music Meets Film, Speaker</span></p></div></a></div></div><div class="person"><div class="person_head"><a href="/helen-sildna"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Helen_Sildna_foto_Kertin_Vasser_Svea_Ideon_51c6039890.jpg" alt="Helen  Sildna"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Helen Sildna</h4><p><span>Music Meets Film, Moderator</span></p></div></a></div></div><div class="person"><div class="person_head"><a href="/michael-paert"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Michael_P_Svea_Ideon_55fcafa00f.jpg" alt="Michael Pärt"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Michael Pärt</h4><p><span>Music Meets Film, Moderator</span></p></div></a></div></div><div class="person"><div class="person_head"><a href="/andrey-a-tarkovsky"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Andrey_Tarkovsky_Svea_Ideon_8c3a5ad84d.jpg" alt="Andrey A.

Creative Gate on loomemajanduse arenduskeskus, mille eesmärk on arendada Eesti audiovisuaalvaldkonna (fookusega teleproduktsioonil) ettevõtlus- ja ekspordipotentsiaali, pakkudes terviklikku tugiteenuste paketti nii filmivaldkonna ettevõtele kui ka sidusvaldkondade ettevõtetele. Projekti rahastab Euroopa Regionaalarengu Fond summas 200 000 eurot.<br>Projekti tulemusena on Eesti audiovisuaaltööstus elujõulisem ja rahvusvaheliselt konkunrentsivõimelisem ning Eesti suudab senisest paremini kasutada oma potentsiaali rahvusvahelise võttepaigana.<br>Loomemajanduse arendamise meedet rahastab Euroopa Regionaalarengu Fond.

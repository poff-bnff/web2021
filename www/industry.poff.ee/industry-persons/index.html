in the south of Germany, Freiburg, as the son of an australian painter and an art managing mother. Through a rough but lovely childhood, I got interest in acting. After being part of Stage Entertainment Musical &quot;Tarzan&quot; for one year, I entered my first acting agency and started to shoot first small movies. At the same time I went to a Waldorf School, which allowed me to get more deeply into acting. As I got older, I was allowed to shoot more bigger movies and tv-productions that helped me to get finally engaged into acting as a professional career. I went to an acting school (&quot;New Talent Schauspielschule&quot;) for two years, changed the agency, and continued my way. I just made the decision, and succeeded to be applied for 2021 to the highly profiled acting school, Hochschule für Musik und Theater Leipzig, to graduate as Master of Arts in four years. Besides acting, I can restore my energy and balance in traveling by myself, experiencing culture and sports. My favourite destination is a farm in Algarve, Potugal, where my godson lives. At least once a year I get engaged in the daily working life of farming, supporting the family and being part of an international community.</span><br><br><br></p></div></div></a></div><div class="person"><a href="/ac-coppens"><div class="person_head"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Screenshot_2020_11_23_at_11_26_24_0264d77b58.png" alt="AC Coppens"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">AC Coppens</h4><p><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><br><br></p></div></div></a></div><div class="person"><a href="/adrian-wootton"><div class="person_head"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Adrian_20_Wootton_20_OBE_Krista_Rodima_8045eafeef.jpg" alt="Adrian  Wootton"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Adrian Wootton</h4><p><span></span><br><span>Manager</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-wootton-obe-23367087/</span><br><span>Adrian Wootton OBE is Chief Executive of Film London and the British Film Commission.

His naive look at reality can attract the audience. He proved that as he played parts in Dywizjon 303 “Historia Prawdziwa” by Denis Delić, and “Legiony” by Dariusz Gajewski. Raised at the farm ploughing the field, he has been developing his skills (including acting) for years while doing his best at every production he took part in. Speaking of which, Antoni fluently speaks English and French. His language skills had an overtone in productions such as BREAKING THE BAND season II: GUNS’N’ROSES by Zoran Trajkovic; 7 GODZIN W POCIĄGU by Miguel Velez. One of his adventures inspired him to learn Russian, and he managed to train figure ice skating at age 23 (with a little help of ballet). Worth mentioning is also his part in epic series “Korona Królów” where his creation of Skirgaila – Polish king’s brother met with the best reception. As important as attracting the audience, Antoni also did his best in preparation with history interview, medieval swordfight, and horse riding. In his acting journey, he also met with Oscar-nominated direction Bartosz Konopka in Netflix Original series “The Woods”.</span><br><br><br></p></div></div></a></div><div class="person"><a href="/arta-giga"><div class="person_head"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/Arta_Giga_Jevgeni_Supin_8d1f105060.jpg" alt="Arta  Ģiga"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Arta Ģiga</h4><p><span></span><br><span>Producer</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><br><br></p></div></div></a></div><div class="person"><a href="/ben-morris"><div class="person_head"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/2020_TVL_W3_Photo_Ben_Morris_Petra_Hrubosova_4a5413af0b.jpg" alt="Ben  Morris"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Ben Morris</h4><p><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>After studying drama at Bristol University, Ben’s first industry job was as a runner at ITV Studios Drama. Subsequently, Ben became Assistant to the Creative Director and he’d only recently made the leap to Junior Script Editor when a show he was assisting on was greenlit by ITV/PBS. This show was Mr Selfridge (10x60). Ben became part of the original creative team that set up the series and its writers' room alongside creator Andrew Davies. He went on to oversee the script process on all four seasons as Script Editor/Executive, eventually writing his own episode in the final season. Soon after, Ben worked with show-runner Kate Brooke to set up contemporary crime thriller Bancroft (4x60 for ITV) which ran for two seasons. Ben was Script Executive/Story Consultant and co-wrote three episodes with Kate across both seasons. As Development Executive, Ben recently oversaw the development and story of Sarah Williams' family mystery drama Flesh and Blood, starring Imelda Staunton, which premiered this February on ITV1. Most recently, he wrote an episode of Kate O'Riordan's new Channel 5 psychological drama Penance, which became one of the highest-rated dramas ever on the channel in March 2020.</span><br><br><br></p></div></div></a></div><div class="person"><a href="/ben-harris"><div class="person_head"><img class="person_img" src="https://assets.poff.ee/img/2020_TVL_W3_Industry_Program_Photo_Ben_Harris_Petra_Hrubosova_4ac8676d78.jpg" alt="Ben Harris"><div class="person_body text_center"><h4 class="text_center">Ben Harris</h4><p><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span>Ben has just finished writing and executive producing Young Wallander, the show he created for Yellowbird and Netflix about the formative experiences of the iconic detective Kurt Wallander.

Ben was the showrunner on Big Light series Ransom for CBS and TF1, based on a real-life crisis negotiator. He also wrote on ITV series Marcella and Dark Heart, and BBC shows The Musketeers, Hunted and The Paradise.

Its main goal is to gather talented scriptwriters with producers attached, in order to provide them support enhancing the script and maximizing its production and distribution potential.\n\nAt the Script Pool Tallinn event five teams consisting of scriptwriters and producers will be competing in Tallinn at the open pitch on the 28th of November. The winner of the competition receives the prize of 5000 euros, provided by the leading international sales & distribution company Global Screen GmbH.\n\nTriin Tramberg, Script Pool competition coordinator, comments: “We are happy to see that our relationship with directors are growing with the years and more and more filmmakers come back to Tallinn with their new films and new projects to set out into the big world.”\n\n#### Selected projects:\n\n***TRANSITION*** **by director and scriptwriter Artem Semakin**\n\nFeature directorial debut *Transition* from Artem Semakin, who is mainly known for being an actor and producer in Russia, but who brings out an interesting family drama mixing road movie and raising transgender issues.\n\n***IN THE BELLY OF A TIGER*** **by director, scriptwriter Jatla Siddhartha**\n\nSiddartha Jatla returns to Tallinn after his directorial debut, Love and Shukla, written with his collaborator Amanda Mooney. Love and Shukla had its European premiere at Tallinn in 2017, and later went on to conquer audiences at festivals around the world before its release on Netflix. Jatla returns to Tallinn with his and Mooney’s intriguing new story, *In the Belly of a Tiger*. The film follows an elderly couple in rural India as they decide who will be killed by a tiger in order to claim government compensation for their family’s survival.\n\n***MOLLY*** **by scriptwriter Nicole Paglia, producer Jessie Mangum**\n\n*Molly* is inspired by true events from 1960’s Soviet Russia, when an American defector and radio DJ broadcasts American pop music and propaganda into a top secret US military base which is buried under the ice in Greenland. Scriptwriter Nicole Paglia has written on Disney’s *101 Dalmation Street*, story edited on *The Amazing World of Gumball*, and is currently developing a number of TV series. Producer Jessie Mangum’s film *Looted* will have its world premiere in this year’s Black Nights First Feature Competition.\n\n***REPLY TO A LETTER FROM HELGA*** **by scriptwriter and director Ása Hjörleifsdóttir** \n\nScriptwriter and director Ása Hjörleifsdóttir whose latest film *The Swan* gained a lot of attention around the world at festivals comes with her new project *Reply to a letter from Helga* – a beautiful yet painful love triangle set in magical Iceland.\n\n***DROPS OF WATER*** **by scriptwriter and director Robert Budina**\n\nRobert Budina’s new project *Drops of Water* is yet again a strong drama this time focusing on the love of a mother and how far will she go to protect her family, especially when things aren’t as they seem. His last film *A Shelter Among the Clouds*, premiered in the Black Nights Film Festival’s Official Selection in 2018.\n\n***MELCHIOR THE APOTHECARY*** **by scriptwriters Elmo Nüganen, Olle Mirme, producer Kristian Taska**\n\nIt is the first Estonian project in the Script Pool Film Competition. *Melchior The Apothecary* by well-known Estonian scriptwriters Elmo Nüganen, Olle Mirme and Kristian Taska is based on the best-selling novel \"Apothecary Melchior and the Mystery of St. Olaf’s Church\" by Indrek Hargla, and the original script created by the author.\n\nSince 2018, Industry@Tallinn has partnered with [MIDPOINT](https://www.midpoint-center.eu/), a training and networking platform with the aim to strengthen the creative collaboration between writers, directors and producers in the development process in Central and Eastern Europe. \n\n**[POWR Baltic Stories Exchange](https://industry.poff.ee/powr-baltic-stories-exchange-2/)** is a 4-day workshop that gives the up-and-coming Nordic and Baltic screenwriters an opportunity to present their projects and writing talent at the largest regional film market in Northeastern Europe.\n\nLike last year, the workshop will be run by experienced tutors Valeria Richter and Helene Granqvist. Selected scriptwriters will **present their projects on the 28th of November**. It is an opportunity to hear the new voices and stories from the Baltic & Nordic film communities, and a voice from this year’s focus region Ireland.\n\n#### Selected projects:\n\n***HYNDAN*** **by Viktor Granö (Finland)**\n\n***EXPLORER*** **(working title) by Hilke Rönnfeldt (Denmark)**\n\n***JUST DESSERTS*** **by Orla Murphy (Ireland)**\n\n***ORIGINAL VOICE*** **by Sandra Olsson (Sweden)**\n\n***QUIET*** **by Larissa Curi (Estonia)** \n\n***THE BURLAKS*** **by Gatis Ungurs (Latvia)**\n\nPOWR Baltic Stories Exchange was launched by our region’s MEDIA Desks with the goal to bring forward the young talent of the Nordic and Baltic countries.

It’s a new challenge, but online-casting is also a phenomenal opportunity for talents from different, underexposed regions to stand out.” \n\nThe programme of Black Nights Stars will focus on how to navigate a career in an online world. “As always, we invite acting professionals from the region to meet international casting experts and to participate at various panels and masterclasses. For accredited professionals we will introduce three topics – what casting directors can do for your project, securing cast and how to get the right actors for your project,” she adds.  \n\n![ind2.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind2_65b1f90714.jpg)\n\n###### Claudia Landsberger, Head of Black Nights Stars Programme\n\nBlack Nights Stars programme is designed to support six talents from the Baltic Sea region. Those talents are selected by an international jury of esteemed casting directors and industry professionals, who will also conduct workshops, masterclasses and one to one meeting with the talents for relevant guidance. “There’s a huge, untapped resource of young talent in the region, so even our very experienced jury will have a tough time choosing. The Black Nights Stars 2020 will be announced shortly,” Landsberger says. \n\n#### International jury of Black Nights Stars\n\n**Magdalena Szwarcbart**, has been assistant director and casting director on films directed by many Polish and international directors including Costa Gavras, Gonzalo Suarez, Michel Piccoli, Peter Kassovitz, Volker Schlöndorff and Steven Spielberg (*Schindler’s List*).

It was a challenge making a selection from all the high-quality submissions.”\n\nEstonian ***After Hours***, a multiplot following a life-changing night of three sisters, is the second collaboration by director Priit Pääsuke and producer Marianne Ostrat, whose former projects have screened at Venice, San Sebastian, and Karlovy Vary. Another female-centric film comes from our Focus Country Italy, with ***Cartacrespa*** by debut director Michele Codarin telling a tale of friendship between two women from vastly different backgrounds. ***Chemistry*** by debut director Adina Dulcu, backed by established producer Tudor Giurgiu, Libra Film Productions, Romania, continues on the theme, portraying the story of a woman whose individual fight evolves into an ideological one in a deeply polarised environment.\n\nWomen are also the main characters in two films exploring the teenage years – French-Finnish ***A Girl’s Room*** by Aino Suni is a thriller about love and manipulation, while Finnish Inari Niemi’s Light ***Light Light Light*** sees a woman on a journey to her adolescence – the summer, which ended in the suicide of her lesbian lover. LGBTQ vs ideology continue to be the main themes in ***Youri*** by Sander Burger, the Netherlands, which follows a talented Russian pianist emigrating from the Soviet Union in fear of certain persecution. Similarly, Hungarian ***Erasing Frank*** by debut director Gabor Fabricius portrays a talented musician, whose career is destroyed and who is driven to fight his war for freedom from a psychiatric ward in the 1980s. Another artist in peril is ***Comrade Dona***, a Romanian sculptor abducted during a stop-over in North Korea, in the film by director Igor Cobileanski and producer Iuliana Tarnovetchi, whose previous collaboration *Eastern Business* was presented at BE 2012 and brought home two awards from the official competition of Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in 2016.\n\nPolitics and mental issues continue to play a role in Kristina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov’s ***Triumph***, the third part of a trilogy based on true events. Icelandic ***Quake*** by yet another debut director Tinna Hrafnsdóttir tells a harrowing tale of a mother concealing her memory loss in order to keep the custody of her son – as a first, the project was also selected to compete in Script Pool Tallinn this year. ***Oxygen*** by Ernestas Jankauskas from Lithuania portrays a woman suffering from anxiety disorder, another issue of critical importance to communicate to the audiences. And Polish ***Patagonia*** by debut director Aga Zwiefka, who has won a string of awards for her documentaries, features a dystopian world, in which suicide is a crime.\n\nMore stories of individuals crushed by the system come from Ukraine, with ***Zenith*** by Igor Stekolenko being a psychological thriller about a talented surgeon losing his career after a wrongful accusation, and Finland, with ***The Oasis of Now*** by debut director Hamy Ramezan, who has won a string of awards for his short films, and Jussi Rantamäki, who produced Cannes award winner *The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki*, telling a story about a family of refugees about to be deported. An equally poetic story of migration is ***Wedding on My Street***, a feature film debut by Shota Gamisonia, Georgia, and the theme of broken families is continued in Latvian ***Lovable*** by director Stanislavs Tokalovs and successful producer tandem Alise Gelze and Aija Berzina.\n\nA **Eurimages Co-Production Development Award** worth 20 000 Euro will be handed out by a jury consisting ofEmma Scott, Production and Distribution Manager, Screen Ireland, Ireland; Jeremy Zelnik, Head of Industry, Les Arcs Film Festival, France; Giovanni Pompili, Producer, Kino Produzioni, Italy.\n\nIn addition, one project will receive the **Screen International Best Pitch Award**, offering coverage of the life-cycle of the winning film, and two producers will receive the **Cannes Marché du Film Producers’ Network Award** for Promising Young Producer with free accreditations to next year’s edition.\n\n#### Baltic Event Co-Production Market selection 2018:\n\n1. ***After Hours***, written by Kristo Kaas and Mart Raun, directed by Priit Pääsuke, produced by Marianne Ostrat, Alexandra Film, Estonia\n2. ***Cartacrespa.*** written by Michele Codarin, Michele Cogo, Nicola Lucchi, Sara Olivieri, and Massimo Vavassori, directed by Michele Codarin, produced by Fabiana Balsamo, Quasar Multimedia, Italy\n3. ***Chemistry***, written and directed by Adina Dulcu, produced by Tudor Giurgiu, Libra Film Productions, Romania\n4. ***Comrade Dona***, written by Filip Columbeanu, directed by Igor Cobileanski, produced by Iuliana Tarnovetchi, Alien Film, Romania\n5. ***Erasing Frank***, written and directed by Gabor Fabricius, produced by Gabor Ferenczy, FocusFox, Hungary\n6. ***A Girl’s Room***, written and directed by Aino Suni, produced by Sébastien Aubert, Adastra Films, France\n7. ***Light Light Light***, written by Juuli Niemi, directed by Inari Niemi, produced by Oskari Huttu, Lucy Loves Drama, Finland\n8. ***Lovable***, written and directed by Stanislavs Tokalovs, produced by Alise Gelze, Tasse Film, Latvia\n9. ***The Oasis of Now***, written by Hamy Ramezan and Antti Rautava, directed by Hamy Ramezan, produced by Jussi Rantamäki, Aamu Film Company, Finland\n10. ***Oxygen***, written by Birute Kapustinskaite, directed by Ernestas Jankauskas, produced by Gabija Siurbyte, Dansu Films, Lithuania\n11. ***Patagonia***, written and directed by Aga Zwiefka, produced by Izabela Igel, Harine FIlms, Poland\n12. ***Quake***, written and directed by Tinna Hrafnsdóttir, produced by Hlín Jóhannesdóttir, Ursus Parvus, Iceland\n13. ***Triumph***, written by Kristina Grozeva, Decho Taralezhkov, and Petar Valchanov, directed by Kistina Grozeva and Petar Valchanov, produced by Kristina Grozeva, Abraxas Film, Bulgaria\n14. ***Wedding on My Street***, written and directed by Shota Gamisonia, produced by Vladimer Chikhradze, LTD 20 Steps Productions, Georgia\n15. ***Youri***, written by Bastiaan Tichler, directed by Sander Burger, produced by Denis Vaslin, Volya Films, Netherlands\n16. ***Zenith***, written by Olga Reka and Igor Stekolenko, directed by Igor Stekolenko, produced by Natalia Libet, Digital Religion, Ukraine\n\n \nSupporters and partners of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event are Creative Europe MEDIA Programme, Eurimages, Cultural Endowment of Estonia, Estonian Film Institute, Lithuanian Film Center, National Film Centre of Latvia, Finnish Film Foundation, Polish Film Institute, Tallink Hotels, Nordic Hotel Forum, Cannes Marche du Film’s Producers’ Network, Post Control, Baltic View, EAVE, Torino Film Lab, MIDPOINT, In Focus, Screen International, Festival Scope, Creative Gate, Shanghai International Film Festival, Tallinn City Enterprise Department, European Regional Development Fund and Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nMarge Liiske\nManaging Director\n+372 514 8134\n[balticevent@poff.ee](balticevent@poff.ee)\n[https://industry.poff.ee](https://industry.poff.ee)\n",

    "contents_en": "[The Black Nights Stars programme](https://industry.poff.ee/black-nights-stars/) is designed to build a bridge between foreign casting directors and new talent from the region – enhancing their international visibility. The aim is to help young actors from the Baltic Sea region promote themselves outside their home territory and acquire the practical skills needed for their future international careers. This year the program will focus on [how to navigate a career in an online world](https://industry.poff.ee/black-nights-stars-focuses-on-navigating-a-career-in-an-online-world/).\n\nThe international jury selected eight young actors from over 40 candidates, who are invited to attend the Black Nights Stars Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, part of the 24th edition of the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÖFF). Previously there have been 6 emerging talents participating in the program each year, in 2020 also two young actors from Russia have been invited as Russia, as well as being part of Baltic Sea region, is this year’s focus country for Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event. \n\nA jury of international film professionals has selected the following actors: \n\n[Aaron Hilmer](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/_compresseds/e11a703a-1e20-439e-99ce-a4ab89374a61.jpg) (Germany), [Antoni Sałaj](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/_compresseds/a2cb6b1b-0650-46c8-bdf3-a018703dec59.jpg) (Poland), [Hanna Ardéhn](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/_compresseds/1c6398a5-044f-432b-94eb-ddafd68c0c48.jpeg) (Sweden), [Henessi Schmidt](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/_compresseds/0977c4fb-b31a-4ff4-ad7f-fccebf7fb360.jpg) (Estonia), [Reimo Sagor](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/images/e6b4a0e4-96dd-4f8b-9cb9-6a9fcfbf1801.jpg) (Estonia), [Simonas Mozūra](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/_compresseds/086bd3cf-e6a7-4c7d-bb98-1ff6ff8ae18a.jpg) (Lithuania), [Vika Sobol](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/images/03dd6cd4-f79e-4234-b55a-a12cc1087bb9.jpg) (Russia) and [Vladislav Kulygin](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/images/636885bd-dfb4-4c72-9065-babf97befa50.jpg) (Russia). \n\nThe young actors have been chosen to present their emerging talent based on their first feature film and TV roles. Participating in Black Nights Stars will give the actors a chance to meet with film professionals and to showcase their talent. They will also participate in various masterclasses, workshops and industry networking events.\n\nAccording to the **member of the international jury, Lina Todd from Lina Todd casting agency**, it was a tremendously gratifying experience to select talent from the Baltics. “Though all unique, they share an amazing presence, an unexpected force, mystery, soulful beauty, fierce intensity, intricate sensuality, and deepness which feels unique to their countries and still universal in their sincerity. It is of great value to the film industry to discover these marvellous and fresh artists who will shine, not just in their country, but internationally. To bring them to the film industry’s attention so they can further enrich our experience as audiences and bring us closer together is a treasure,” she added. \n\nThe 2020 selection jury included **Lina Todd**, a casting director from New York (*Little Man Tate, A Good Day to Die Hard, Crazy Alien*); **Mike Rosser** (*Screen International*), former European Shooting Star and 2018 Black Nights Star **Pääru Oja** (*O2, The Last Ones*); US born casting director **Nancy Bishop**, based in Europe (*The Liberator, the Romanoffs, Whiskey Cavalier*) and **Magdalena Szwarcbart**, casting director from Poland (*Schindler’s List, Cold War, Gareth Jones*). \n\nThe programme of Black Nights Stars 2020 will be carried out as an online event at [Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event](https://industry.poff.ee/) taking place during 23-27 November. The Black Nights Stars programme is presented by the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event during the [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://poff.ee/en/) and the European Regional Development Fund funded project Creative Gate.

    "contents_en": "The preparations for the 24th edition of the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival include the readiness to provide global industry and press access for the films and events, while preparations for holding a physical event are still underway.\n\nFollowing the first signs of the possible resurgence of COVID-19 in the country, the organisers of the festival and its affiliated industry event have followed the predictions of the Health Board of Estonia and made the decision to move the industry programs online, while continuing to accept project submissions. The global film industry representatives will still be able to apply for access to all events, project pitches and films regardless of their geographical location.\n\nMarge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented: „Following the discussions with Estonia’s health officials, it seems more than likely that there will be another outbreak in one form or another and that foreign travel will either be blocked or with restrictions. This would not enable for our guests to attend the events properly and thus, with a heavy heart, we have decided from early on to not to take any risks and move all our activities online this year.”\n\n“Having said that, I believe that moving online also presents us with some new opportunities and also for the audience – we hope that even more film industry professionals than before are able to benefit from our program, as they do not have to travel to Tallinn to attend the events and they can access the content from anywhere at their best convenience. Also, while preparing the programme we can play around with different engaging digital formats and involve speakers, who would not be able to visit us in Tallinn,” Liiske added.\n\nThe team is currently busy working on the programme and the first speakers will be announced in September. The programme will include seminars, workshops, masterclasses, panel discussions, as usual, covering the most burning topics of film and TV market as well as PÖFF Academy events directed towards actors, scouting agents, film music composers, costume designers and set photographers. \n\nCurrently, [submissions](https://industry.poff.ee/project-entry/) are open for [Baltic Event Co-production Market](https://industry.poff.ee/co-production-market/) (projects seeking co-producers, financiers and sales agents), [Script Pool Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/script-pool-tallinn/) (film and series scripts worldwide competition) and [POWR Baltic Stories Exchange](https://industry.poff.ee/powr-baltic-stories-exchange-2-2/) (Nordic and Baltic scriptwriters seeking producers). The deadline for submitting the projects is September, 25 and the evaluation of the projects is carried out online. Everyone who has submitted the project has access to Industry @Tallinn & Baltic event online-program including workshops, masterclasses, panel discussions, meetings with industry professionals, etc. \n\nThe programme will be announced in various stages throughout September and October.\n\nBlack Nights Film Festival is making preparations for several scenarios.\n\nSince the first COVID-19-related lockdown in spring, Black Nights has been preparing for several possible scenarios, getting ready to take place physically while also upgrading the digital infrastructure that would enable to organise a hybrid or even a completely digital event. It looks likely that foreign travel to Estonia will be restricted, thus accredited foreign press and industry delegates will be granted access to the festival’s programme digitally via the Shift72 platform, no matter their geographic location. Travel of foreign filmmakers and the press will be decided upon according to the situation in October and November, depending on whether Estonia’s COVID restrictions allow movement from the country of their current residency or not.\n\nThe physical screenings, however, have not been cancelled, as the Health Board of Estonia currently remains optimistic that the complete lockdown of cinemas can be avoided this time around. As the festival has always hosted several hundred filmmakers to present their films every year, some might be forced to do so virtually this year. For this reason, the festival is preparing virtual video greeting and Q&A formats that would precede the film screenings. There is also a high probability that the festival will cut back on the size of its programme this year.\n\nTiina Lokk, the director and head of the programme of Black Nights commented: “Our off-season side events, the Haapsalu Horror Film Festival we organised completely online during the lockdown this spring, and the Tartu Love Film Festival which is currently taking place as a hybrid event, have provided us with the valuable experience of organising virtual screenings and Q&As and combining them with a physical event. We are doing everything in our power to hold physical screenings and bring over as many foreign guests as possible, but the virus and Estonia’s Health Board will have the final say in these matters.” \n\nThe festival’s plans for digital development goes further than this though, including plans to build, over the course of the next couple of years, a unique online environment that caters the festival’s needs in terms of organising public and closed screenings, conferences and an extensive online industry platform that includes a market place, virtual meeting and pitching rooms and a year-around project market to connect projects at all stages of their cycle with respective parties of interest – financiers, producers, distributors etc.\n\nAnother important aspect will be the year-around promotion of Estonia as a location for production and recruiting talent, including the introduction of locations of interest, a database of the country’s professionals, exhibiting the services they provide and the content they have produced. Estonia’s first two regional film funds – the Viru Film Fund and the Tartu Film Fund – will be in charge of keeping the locations and talent pools up to date.\n\nThe third fundamental element of the new platform is education, that will see the launch of PÖFF Academy aiming to provide high-quality audiovisual education with partners at the Estonian Film Institute, the Baltic Film, Media, Art and Communication School and the Pallas University of Applied Sciences. This will be based on the structure that has been laid out by the Creative Gate project, organised by the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event team, that has been holding events directed towards actors, scouting agents, film music composers, costume designers and set photographers over the last three years, and which added the European Film Academy Masterclasses into the mix last year.\n\nFestival director Tiina Lokk commented:  „Some of the changes that are being prepared will actually rewire the festival’s DNA, making it more digital, networked, ubiquitous and inclusive than ever before! But first and foremost, we are hoping to make the physical festival still happen this year!” she added.",

    "contents_en": "[The Conference](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11258824/) is the fourth feature of Russian director Ivan I. Tverdovskiy. Previous films of the 31-year old director have been the festival hits Corrections Class, Zoologia, and Jumpman.\n\nAccording to the website of Giornate degli Autori the line up for this year’s takes us through an amazing journey through space and time. It starts in rural China in the 1990s (***Mama***, a sober and remarkably mature debut by Chinese filmmaker **Li Dongmei**), leaps to Palestine (***200 Meters***, an Italian-Palestinian co-production directed by **Ameen Nayfeh** and starring **Ali Suliman**, one of the top Arab actors today), then arrives to Eastern Europe.\n\nGiornate’s lineup takes you from Russia’s Far North, a Siberia ambivalent about the consumer culture (***The Whaler Boy*** by newcomer **Philipp Yurye** and co-produced by the late **Marion Hänsel**), then to Moscow, with its political secrets and moral dilemmas (***Conference***) and on to Hungary and impossible love affairs (***Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time***, by **Lili Horvát**) and to Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina – all in the same film – ***Oasis*** by Serbian filmmaker **Ivan Ikić**.\n\nItaly is obviously on the itinerary: specifically Puglia, with ***Stonebreaker ***by the **De Serio** brothers. France and Algerian roots appear in ***Honey Cigar*** (debut by **Kamir Aïnouz**). Giornate also crosses the Atlantic and washes up in Canada (***Saint-Narcisse*** by **Bruce LaBruce**) and the United States (***Residue***, a stirring debut by **Merawi Gerima**). Lastly, Giornate drops down to Santiago de Chile, setting off a queer love story at the time of the Pinochet regime (***Tengo miedo torero*** by **Rodrigo Sepúlveda**).\n\n[Giornate degli Autori](http://www.giornatedegliautori.com/index.asp?lang=eng) was born in 2004, as an independent sidebar of the Venice Film Festival. The aim of the event is to draw attention to high-quality cinema, without any kind of restriction, with special care for innovation, research, originality and independence. These are all features of the 12 films selected as well as being reflected in the special events held during the Days in the **Villa** degli Autori.",

What will the future bring to the genre film production is not clear, but we hope that the situation does not stop you creating and developing the ideas and that the halt of the film industry is temporary. The moment is right to imagine what kind of stories would happen in this new world. Eager to find out about your latest film ideas, European Genre Forum (EGF) has decided to postpone the deadline for submitting your projects to the beginning of May! So take your chance and send in your film idea! \n\nAt the moment we can’t say for sure that EGF 2020 will take place in full capacity, but we want to give it a try. Hence, EGF finds best to follow the situation, continue with the project selection and extend the deadline of project submission to May 4th.  Thanks to all of you who have sent yours already!\n\nThe European Genre Forum (EGF), taking place for 6th year in 2020, is a training programme aimed at European directors developing their 1st or 2nd feature-length genre film project with an established producer attached. The programme sets to boost the careers of future European players in the genre film industry through two talent labs, packed with trainings, panels mentoring and pitching sessions. *The Producing Lab* takes place in Zagreb during Fantastic Zagreb in July. *The Marketing&Packaging Lab* takes place in Tallinn during PÖFF, in the final week of November.\n\nRead further: [https://industry.poff.ee/european-genre-forum-2/](https://industry.poff.ee/european-genre-forum-2/)\n\nSubmit your idea: [https://europeangenreforum.com/](https://europeangenreforum.com/)\n\nPhoto: Visual of Utopia, project participating EGF in 2019\n\n",

    "contents_en": "[Script Pool Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/script-pool-tallinn/), an international script competition taking place for the 4th time in 2020, has announced its participants in its film category.  The main goal of the competition is to gather talented scriptwriters with producers attached and to provide them support in enhancing the script and maximising its production and distribution potential. During the competition the participants get to work together with well-known script doctors and pitching mentors. Each project will have the chance to pitch their story to a top specialist in the field and get one-to-one feedback. \n\nAccording to Triin Tramberg, the manager of Script Pool, the global lockdown had an incredible influence on creating new films. “We had a record number of submissions and decision making was not easy at all. The five projects we selected differ from each other but are equally interesting to read and have great potential to thrive in the international film industry,” she added.   \n\n##### Script Pool Film selected projects: \n\n- *20,000 Species of Bees* (Spain), screenwriter Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren, from the production company Gariza Films and Sirimiri Films; \n- *Franky Five Star* (Germany, Finland), screenwriters Knut Mierswe and Birgit Möller, production company Achtung Panda! \n- *Ghost in The House* (Iceland), screenwriters Olaf de Fleur Johannesson and Hrafnkell Stefansson, production company Poppoli Pictures; \n- *The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo* (Chile), writer Diego Céspedes, production company Quijote Films; \n- *A Smile Worthwhile* (Turkey, Estonia), screenwriter Sefa Öztürk, production company Purple Pigeon Productions.  \n\nThe main award of 5000 Euro prize is given to a writer-producer team by the jury that includes **Patrick Fisher** (managing director of Creative Capital), **Patrik Andersson** (Producer of Midsommar, 2019, Euphoria, 2017) and **Agathe Maurac** (Head of International Sales at Pyramide International). \n\n[POWR Baltic Stories Exchange](https://poff.ee), organised for the 13th time, is a training programme for Nordic and Baltic scriptwriters, actively seeking producers, to develop film projects currently in the early stages of development. We will also host a project as part of Russia in Focus 2020. \n\n“This year we are excited to welcome our first Faroese filmmaker and the stories cover a broad spectre including a post-alien invasion drama, a Latvian mockumentary, modern folklore and a Russian generational drama. We are 50/50 on the gender account and can’t wait to present a great mix of POWR pitches in November,” said Valeria Richter, Head of Studies for POWR since the start. \n\nDuring the intensive group-based workshop taking place online during Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event (November 19-22), the selected screenwriters will practice the skills to pitch their projects through group sessions, talks and rehearsals. In 2020, the workshop is led by the 2 pitch coaches, Valeria Richter (Denmark) and Helene Granqvist (Sweden), both of the Nordic Factory outfit. \n\n#### POWR Baltic Stories Exhange selected projects include: \n\n- *Zurab Dzhidzhilava* (Latvia/Georgia) – The Man Who Desalinated the Sea; \n- *Joseph Valentino Palau* (Denmark) – The Gleam; \n- *Keren Klimovsky* (Faingersh) (Sweden) – Little Red Helmet; \n- *Mariann Sofiasdóttir* (Denmark/Faroe Islands) – Not the End of the World; \n- *Ave Goršič* (Estonia) – Way to Home; \n- *Vasily Zorkiy* (Russia) – Weird Fishes. \n\nPOWR workshop is organized by Baltic Event in collaboration with the region’s Creative Europe MEDIA Desks. \n",

    "contents_en": "Based in Amsterdam, NOOR is one of the world’s leading photojournalism agencies and — like Black Nights — a pilot partner of FotoInMotion. Even if its roster of award-winning photographers has covered some of the most important stories over the past four decades, NOOR itself was only formed 12 years ago as a new model for a professional cooperative that maintains the time-honoured values and techniques of photojournalism with a commitment to explore new media and the cutting edges of technology.\n\nLike the films at POFF, NOOR was launched at an international festival. It was the 2007 edition of perhaps the world’s top such event for the photojournalism world: the *Visa pour L’Image* festival in the French city of Perpignan. \n\nNOOR managing director Clement Saccomani has been coming to Perpignan for 15 years, dating back to his own start as a freelance photographer and his previous post as editorial director of the Magnum photo agency. At this year’s edition of *Visa pour L’Image* in September, Saccomani reflected on the state of photojournalism amid fast-changing technology and business realities, and the role of festivals to help drive the industry forward.\n\n#### For an agency like NOOR, why has Visa pour L’Image been so important?\n\nSACCOMANI: Perpignan has been the only place where you knew that all the important actors of the industry from around the world would show up. So it’s a great moment for photographers to show the work that is still unpublished but also to meet clients, colleagues and also the next generation of photojournalists and storytellers. It’s a moment to learn and share, and network. \n\n#### How has the festival changed in recent years?\n\nThere are more and more new digital actors and software manufacturers, and fewer media. There are more photographers, though fewer established top pros are coming every year like they used to. Technology has made the festival less important for some, but more important for others. \n\n#### What do you say about the criticism that the festival has not evolved enough with the changing technology, that it’s remained basically the same, focused almost entirely on displaying still photographs?\n\nMost photographers today are not only working in still images from a camera but also producing moving images, using drones and their smartphones. There has to be room for this, to support new ways of doing journalism and support the creative process of video production for photojournalists.  NOOR photographers, Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, completed a major project last year on the Arctic, which was the first time we reached 40% of our revenue from video.\n\nThe large crowds at Visa seem to defy all the doom and gloom about the state of photojournalism, particularly economically. \n\nThere is a real growing infatuation with photography, and with journalism more generally, which you see in exhibitions and a festival like this. What I like so much about FotoInMotion is that it’s a tool to try to allow photojournalism to convert that interest and experience outside of physical exhibit space and into our regular consumption of content in the digital space. \n\n###### Lead image: *Instagram/ Rencontres d’Arles*",

    "contents_en": "The conversation panel named “Choosing Doors: A Conversation with Danny Elfman” will discuss the paths Elfman has chosen in his creative life. After the initial conversation, participants will have the possibility to ask questions online from the composer directly.* The panel will be hosted by Marko Ahtisaari, Artistic Director of Helsinki Festival, designer entrepreneur and one half of the band Construction.  \n\nFor over 30 years, **Danny Elfman** has established himself as one of the sought-after and acclaimed film composers in the world. A native of Los Angeles, Elfman grew up loving film music. He travelled the world as a young man, absorbing its musical diversity. He helped found the band Oingo Boingo, and came to the attention of a young Tim Burton, who asked him to write the score for *Pee-wee´s Big Adventure*. 34 years later, the two have forged one of the most fruitful composer-director collaborations in film history. In addition to his film work, Elfman wrote the iconic theme music for the television series *The Simpsons* and *Desperate Housewives*. \n\nDuring his long career, Elfman has collaborated with directors including Tim Burton, Gus Van Sant, Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, Rob Minkoff, Guillermo del Toro, Brian De Palma, James Ponsoldt and David O´ Russell. Beginning with his first score on Tim Burton´s *Pee-wee´s Big Adventure*, Elfman has scored over 100 films, including *Milk* (Oscar-nominated), *Good Will Hunting* (Oscar-nominated), *Big Fish* (Oscar-nominated), *Men in Black* (Oscar-nominated), *Edward Scissorhands*, *Batman*, *To Die For*, *The Nightmare Before Christmas*, *Alice in Wonderland*, *Silver Linings Playbook*, American Hustle*, *Justice League*, *Spiderman*, *A Simple Plan*, *Midnight Run*, *Sommersby*, *Dolores Claiborne*, and the Errol Morris documentaries *The Unknown Known* and *Standard Operating Procedure*. Most recently he has provided music for Tim Burton film *Dumbo* for Disney, and *The Grinch* for Universal, and is currently working on the upcoming film *The Voyage of Dr Doolittle* (2020), starring Robert Downey Jr. \n\nThe programme of Music Meets Film, taking place for the 9th time in 2020, is primarily intended for composers and musicians aiming to create music for film and takes a look into what makes a film composer tick and how does the production aspect of music and film affect creative decisions.  \n\n* *The panel “Choosing Doors: A Conversation with Danny Elfman” will take place on Wednesday, November 25 at 19:00 (CET). Everyone with accreditation to Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event will have the opportunity to watch the event live or as catchup later.*  \n\nIndustry@Tallinn & Baltic Event is the one-week summit for film and audiovisual industry professionals held during PÖFF, on November 23-27, 2020. This year’s summit takes place fully online, welcoming projects and participants from around the globe. In 2020, Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event introduces Russia in Focus, a global presentation of Russian audiovisual content, film projects and creative talents at one of the key international co-production markets and producer’s platforms to build strong ties between Russian and international creative industry players.  \n\nCheck out the programme at [industry.poff.ee](industry.poff.ee). \n\n*Photo: [Danny Elfman by Brian Averill](https://mcusercontent.com/c2426593c5ba2369b6e13a66e/images/3dc05bd1-2c3f-4587-a67e-85a98aea89e4.jpg)*",

    "contents_en": "According to Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, it has been repeatedly pointed out that 2020 is a year when the demand for content has increased significantly, and drama series are now a natural part of many film industry events. “I am thrilled that together with MIDPOINT TV Launch, we have several new drama series projects from Europe onboard. In addition to the public pitching, we offer them a platform to set up one-to-one meetings with our industry guests, in order for them to find collaboration partners to proceed with their projects,” she adds.\n\nMIDPOINT TV Launch, a co-operating partner of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event since 2018, is an \"idea-to-market\" series project development program for creative teams of emerging professionals mostly coming from the Central and Eastern European region. Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event hosts the third and final workshop of MIDPOINT TV Launch 2020, with nine projects participating.  The previous events taking place in June and September, all online due to the restrictions connected to the global pandemic.\n\n“During the last week in November, the participants of MIDPOINT TV Launch will be encouraged to explore the rich programme of the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, use the platform to network, and for the first time, present their projects at an industry event and market. The highlight of this third session is understandably the pitching of the graduating projects, followed by one-to-one meetings with the industry professionals and decision makers invited to the event,” Katarina Tomkova, Program Coordinator at MIDPOINT commented. “The HBO Europe Award of 5000 USD will be granted to the Best Project at the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event award ceremony,” she added. In addition, the MIDPOINT Institute will bring several panel discussions and events to the programme.\n\nScript Pool Tallinn, an international script competition taking place for the 4th time in 2020, presents five projects in its TV and drama series category, including projects from Poland, Italy, North Macedonia, a co-production from Latvia and Lithuania and a project from Estonia. Manager of Script Pool Tallinn, Triin Tramberg comments: “This year’s selection stands out, because while keeping our competition international, we see an increasing demand from regional series to take part at Script Pool. For the first time we have two Baltic projects in the competition, bringing a spotlight to the region.”\n\nScript Pool Tallinn’s main goal is to gather talented scriptwriters with producers attached and to provide them support in enhancing their scripts and maximising production and distribution potential. Before the competition, the participants get advice from well-known script doctors and pitching mentors. The main award of a 5000 Euro prize is given to two writer-producer teams – one for outstanding script in film and one in the TV series category.\n\nThe Script Pool TV/drama jury includes **Julie Hodge** (Fremantle, Editorial Director at Global Drama), **Anna Katharina Brehm** (Production and Content Director at Seriencamp Conference) and **Toomas Ili** (Head Of Content Acquisitions, Elisa).\n \n#### MIDPOINT TV Launch 2020 participating projects\n\n- *Afterparty* (Croatia), writer Dora Sustic, producer Maja Pek-Bruenjes\n- *Agents* (Serbia), writer Gvozden Djuric, producer/director Uros Tomic\n- *Hotel Intercontinental* (Hungary) writers Andras Voros and Peter Akar, producer Laszlo Dreissiger\n- *Hugo & Co.* (Czech Republic) writer Tomas Plhon, producer Gordon Lovitt\n- *Lazlo* (Latvia), writers Ermins Baltais and Kristina Martinuka, producer Aija Berzina\n-  *Black Square* (Ukraine) writer/director Daria Onyshchenko, writer/producer Anna Palenchuk\n- *The Red Princess* (Czech Republic), writer Barbora Namerova, producer Milos Lochman\n- *The Neighbours* (Ukraine)  writer/producer Alexandra Tkachenko, writer/producer  Marina Chikalovets\n- *NOSTOS* (Greece) writer Stavros Pamballis and writer/producer Christos V.

    "contents_en": "The main goal of Script Pool Tallinn, is to gather talented scriptwriters with producers attached, in order to provide them support enhancing the script and maximising its production and distribution potential. Adding the TV and drama series category to the competition for its 3rd edition can be considered as a reaction to the unavoidable change in the industry, where the series market is taking over and people prefer content by global streaming platforms. This gives an opportunity for local authentic stories to travel without language barriers. \n\n“Since the very first year of the Script Pool competition, we have wanted it to have two directions – feature film and drama series,” Triin Tramberg, Script Pool competition coordinator comments. “We are more than excited to finally begin with the Script Pool TV drama series competition and especially that we can also show what kind of series Estonia makes,” she adds.\n\nAt the Script Pool Tallinn event, six teams consisting of scriptwriters and producers will be at the open pitch on the 26th of November before the international  jury and other decision-makers from the industry including **Kamila Zlatušková**, Independent TV producer from the Czech Republic, **Dominic Schreiber**, Global Drama Executive, at leading independent drama producer and distributor, Reel One Entertainment and **Benjamin Harris**, a writer and producer with over 15 years experience in the industry. The winner of the competition receives a prize of 5000 euros, provided by the leading international sales & distribution company Global Screen GmbH. \n\n#### The selected projects for the TV drama category:\n\n- Produced by Estonian Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated production house Allfim in co-production with Sweden and Germany ***The Deep*** written by Lauri Lippmaa is a political crime thriller that raises the questions; Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we heading?\n\n- ***The Secret Society of Souptown and the Cucumber Mafia*** is an 8-part TV-series sequel to the most successful Estonian family film by the well known Estonian screenwriters Andris Feldmanis and Livia Ulman, who have created several popular Estonian TV-series. Their debut feature film *Teesklejad* (*Pretenders*, director Vallo Toomla) was released in 2016, having its world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\n-  ***Court of Muses***, developed by Julia Effertz and Luxembourg’s Wady Films, is a bold and dark, unapologetic vision of female supremacy that has wandered all the way across the abyss of human nature.\n\n- ***The Holy Family*** is a family drama series with a supernatural twist. 17-year-old high school student Ábel might be a new Messiah, but his mysterious wrist wounds are considered suicide attempts by his family. The TV-series is written by Gábor Osváth, who was chosen to be one of the Emerging Producers (2016), and one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in 2015. Yvonne Kerékgyártó is a SXSW Gamechanger award-winner scriptwriter-director of the 2014 feature *Free Entry*. More recently she was the screenwriter of *FOMO*, which had its international premiere at PÖFF.\n\n- ***Crossing place*** is a supernatural mystery drama about a writer in search of her boyfriend in an Irish border village and finds folklore seeping into reality. The series is by Gary Duggan, an award-winning playwright & screenwriter. His plays have been produced across Ireland, Europe and in New York.\n\n- ***Different*** is a horror anthology of ten loosely interconnected stories that explore the myths of Central Europe through the lives of different entities existing among us. The series wants to show different types of beings or creatures in several time periods struggling with the same dilemmas: is it a gift or a curse to be different? The series is created by Petr Koubek, a FAMU scriptwriting department graduate, who has written TV series for Czech Television Lynč, The Manor House, Národní klenoty and TV Nova Ulice, Dáma a Král and a number of commercials.\n\nSince 2018, Industry@Tallinn has partnered with [MIDPOINT](https://www.midpoint-center.eu/), a training and networking platform with the aim to strengthen the creative collaboration between writers, directors and producers in the development process in Central and Eastern Europe. \n\n[Read about the projects selected for Script Pool feature films in 2019](https://industry.poff.ee/script-pool-tallinn/)",

Inspired by real life events, the 6-episode action-drama brings out some sore questions of our time. An Afghan War veteran, deeply disappointed in life, starts to detonate bombs in Tallinn, trying to fix the world he regards as broken, leading to a cat and mouse between him and a controversial top investigator of the security services.\n\nThe past years have seen first screenings of several new Russian series for the first time outside their country of origin that have later become international success stories. Last year’s entry from Russia screened under the name Outbreak and later became a top-watched series on Netflix under the name To The Lake. Another Russian series, **Call Center**, by directing duo **Natasha Merkulova** and **Alexey Chupov** („The Man Who Surprised Everyone“, „Intimate Parts“) had its world premiere at Black Nights.\n\nThis year Russia is headed by **Psycho**, created by the prolific director Fedor Bondarchuk and producer (Stalingrad, Arrival, Invasion) who presents the tale of a elitist psychotherapist Oleg on the eve of his 40-s birthday. He shares an apartment with his mother and suffers from a middle age crisis, lack of self-respect, drug addiction, irritability and increasing aggression.\nA year ago Oleg’s wife disappeared – she has been missing for 384 days...\n\nKaren Oganesyan’s **The Big Game** offers survival and psychological thriller about the participants of an extreme reality show.\n\nAfter screening the first season of the hit series **An Ordinary Woman** by director-scriptwriter **Nataliya Meshchaninova** („Heart of the World“, „The Hope Factory“), the story of the brothel keeper Marina continues as she has a baby and gets into trouble with some mobsters.\n\nIn **Chicks** four female sex workers try to start a brand-new life in a small, patriarchal and religious Russian town – and face immediate consequences for their brave act.\n\n**Dead Mountain – The Dyatlov Pass Incident** is a fresh take on infamous Dyatlov incident, based on the de-classified files of the real-life case that has had people spinning wild theories all over the world for more than 60 years, ranging from avalanches, to secret weapon tests, to alien interference.\n\n**Sherlock: The Russian Chronicles** is a glossy mystery and action thriller throws a Russian spin on one of the world’s most famous characters. The series follows the esteemed detective from London to the Russian Empire, on the trail of a suspected serial murderer.\n\nDirector Arkadiy Nepytalyuk’s **There will be People** depicts the turbulent periods of the beginning of the 20th century through the eyes of ordinary people: the First World War, the revolution, the emergence of Soviet regime.\n\nAmong the other European countries in the selection are the Spanish series **Tell Me Who I Am** that begins in the year 1998 when a man by the leaves a thick biography on the desk of a successful publisher. It is the story of Javier’s mother he never knew. Before fate can finally reunite mother and son, Amelia will have taken a long journey, starting in tumultuous Madrid of 1934.\n\nDanish **Cry Wolf** is the intense and emotional story of a teenage girl who has written a vivid school essay detailing her stepfather’s violent behavior. The parents deny the accusations, but who is lying – and who is telling the truth?\n\n**Swiss Labyrinth of Peace** offers a high-budget portrait of an industrial family dynasty that is inspired by true yet little-known events in post-WWII „neutral“ Switzerland where the dark secrets reveal the amoral choices taken by many people in places of political and financial power.\n\nFrom outside of Europe, TV Beats screens the Brazilian series **Basic Unit** that is inspired by real life cases, telling the story in of two physicians of a basic care unit in Brazil, faced by challanges created by both their work and very opposing views.\n\nIn US series **City So Real**, Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Steve James’ („Hoop Dreams“) fascinating and complex portrait of contemporary Chicago delivers a deep, multifaceted look into the soul of a quintessentially American city, set against the backdrop of its history-making 2019 mayoral election, and the tumultuous 2020 summer of COVID-19 and social upheaval following the police killing of George Floyd.\n\n\n**Production details**\n\nAn Ordinary Woman 2 |Обычная женщина 2\nGenre: drama\n2020, Russia\nYear of release - Season 2 in 2020\nDirector: Nataliya Meshchaninova\n\nBasic Unit| Unidade Básica\nGenre: drama\n2020, Brazil\nChannel of release: Universal TV\nDirector: Carolina Fioratti, Caco Ciocler\nCreator: Newton Cannito, Helena Petta, Ana Petta\n\nChicks | Чики\nGenre: drama\n2020, Russia\nChannel or release: More tv\nDirector: Eduard Oganesyan\n\nCity So Real\nGenre: drama\nDirector: Steven James\n\nCry Wolf |Ulven Kommer\nGenre: Drama\n2020, Denmark\nChannel of release: DR1 / Denmark\nDirector: Carolina Fioratti, Caco Ciocler\nCreator: Maja Jul Larsen, Pernille Fischer Christensen, May El-Toukhy, Samanou Sahlstrøm\nProducer / Production Company: DR Drama\n\nDead Mountain – The Dyatlov Pass Incident|Перевал Дятлова\nBroadcaster: Premier.One and TNT Russia\n2020, Russia\n\nIn The Line Of Fire | Tulejoonel\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n2020\nBroadcaster: Elisa Huub\nDirector: Ergo Kuld\n\nLabyrinth of Peace\nBroadcaster: SRF\n2020, Switzerland\nBroadcaster: Movistar+\nDate: tba 2020\n\nPsycho\n2020, Russia\nDirector: Fedor Bondarchuk\n\nSherlock: The Russian Chronicles I Шерлок в России\nGenre: Mystery action thriller\nPlatform of release: START\n2020, Russia\nDirector Nurbek Egen\nProducer / production company: Sreda, START, Yellow, Black and White.\n\nTell Me Who I Am | Dime Quién Soy\nGenre: historical drama\n2020, Spain\nDirector: José Manuel Lorenzo\n\nThe Big Game | Igra Na Vyzhivanije\n2020, Russia\nDirector: Karen Oganesyan\n\nThere Will Be People\nGenre and format: period drama, saga\nYear: 2020\nChannel of release: STB\nDirector: Arkadiy Nepytalyuk",

    "contents_en": "Music Meets Film, a part of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, taking place for the 8th time has announced its programme and focuses on film music composers’ source of creativity this year. The exhaustive programme brings together award-winning British composer Richard Harvey, forensic musicologist Peter Oxendale as well as renown composers Michael J McEvoy, Tom Player and Mihkel Zilmer.\n\nMusic Meets Film, curated by Estonian Music Producer and Music Editor Michael Pärt, brings together composers and directors; from music and sound creatives through to producers, agents and the wider music – and film industry. It is to build bridges between creatives, grow as an interdisciplinary meeting place and encourage new International collaborations\n\nThe first day of the programme introduces current **scoring trends and the future direction** of the industry, presented by award-winning composers from England, Finland and Estonia. We will also learn about the importance of production music and making the most out of music licensing.\n\nThe second day is held at the recently opened **Arvo Pärt Centre in Laulasmaa**, with British forensic musicologist and copyright infringement specialist **Peter Oxendale** speaking about common copyright misconceptions followed by **three case studies by renowned film composers Richard Harvey, Michael J McEvoy and Mihkel Zilmer**. The day will conclude with a feature-length documentary film “Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound” (2019), directed by Midge Costin. Throughout this day we will hear the sound through Estelon’s flagship loudspeakers “Estelon Extreme”. Estelon is an Estonian hi-end loudspeaker maker and a partner of the Arvo Pärt Centre.\n\nOn the third day, at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre, MMF takes an in-depth approach through **masterclasses and composing mentorship sessions**. American Multi-instrumentalist and composer Michael McEvoy takes a detailed look at a thematic approach within film scoring and explores the world of “leitmotifs”. Composer Tom Player leads a masterclass focusing on Physical vs. Virtual instruments and composer Mihkel Zilmer will share his experience from score spotting sessions with directors. \n\nThe 8th Music Meets Film takes place 25-27 November, 2019. In 2019 Music Meets Film partners up with West One Music, a British production music company established in the heart of London’s Soho in 2002.\n\n[Read more about the programme and the mentors](https://industry.poff.ee/music-meets-film/)",

The exhaustive programme brings together award-winning British composer Richard Harvey, forensic musicologist Peter Oxendale as well as renown composers Michael J McEvoy, Tom Player and Mihkel Zilmer.\n\nMusic Meets Film, curated by Estonian Music Producer and Music Editor Michael Pärt, brings together composers and directors; from music and sound creatives through to producers, agents and the wider music – and film industry. It is to build bridges between creatives, grow as an interdisciplinary meeting place and encourage new International collaborations\n\nThe first day of the programme introduces current **scoring trends and the future direction** of the industry, presented by award-winning composers from England, Finland and Estonia. We will also learn about the importance of production music and making the most out of music licensing.\n\nThe second day is held at the recently opened **Arvo Pärt Centre in Laulasmaa**, with British forensic musicologist and copyright infringement specialist **Peter Oxendale** speaking about common copyright misconceptions followed by **three case studies by renowned film composers Richard Harvey, Michael J McEvoy and Mihkel Zilmer**. The day will conclude with a feature-length documentary film “Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound” (2019), directed by Midge Costin. Throughout this day we will hear the sound through Estelon’s flagship loudspeakers “Estelon Extreme”. Estelon is an Estonian hi-end loudspeaker maker and a partner of the Arvo Pärt Centre.\n\nOn the third day, at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre, MMF takes an in-depth approach through **masterclasses and composing mentorship sessions**. American Multi-instrumentalist and composer Michael McEvoy takes a detailed look at a thematic approach within film scoring and explores the world of “leitmotifs”. Composer Tom Player leads a masterclass focusing on Physical vs. Virtual instruments and composer Mihkel Zilmer will share his experience from score spotting sessions with directors. \n\nThe 8th Music Meets Film takes place 25-27 November, 2019. In 2019 Music Meets Film partners up with West One Music, a British production music company established in the heart of London’s Soho in 2002.\n\n[Read more about the programme and the mentors](https://industry.poff.ee/music-meets-film/)",

    "contents_en": "Festival director Tiina Lokk considers the event highly important. “PÖFF BlackWalk is the first step in creating a cohesive network of training programs that bring people together from different areas of the film industry. The EFA has around 3000 professional members across Europe – our collaboration means to use this network and channel it into the local education system”.\n\nThis year’s project is a development of last year’s PÖFF: Black Catwalk. Laura Kurs, the event’s head organiser confirms that this year’s program is one step closer to what they really want to achieve. “We want to create a sustainable education program for our young film lovers. By working with the EFA, we are able to establish direct contact with film industry professionals and build lasting relationships with them. Hopefully, we will be able to arouse an indelible affection towards film in costume designers, make-up, hair and video artists,” she adds.\n\nIn this year’s program knowledge and advice is shared by: visual artist **Peter Hjorth** (*Antichrist, Melancholia, Nymphomaniac: Vol I*), make-up artist **Dalia Colli** (Dogman, Casanova), hair artist **Daniela Tartari** (*Broken Embraces, Like Crazy*) and costume designer **Stefanie Bieker** (*Land of Mine, Only Lovers Left Alive*). \n\nPÖFF BlackWalk’s gala will feature three mini-collections, which are created with the specifics of costume art in mind and which are inspired by the selected films of the young Estonian designers – Annika Kiidron, Liina Liesment and Reila Saarmäe. The fashion show with an emphasis on the film industry is also the culmination of a two-month training program in which young fashion designers, make-up, hair and video artists were lectured and supported by the EFA’s acknowledged creative directors.\n\nPÖFF BlackWalk’s gala night will take place on 26 of November in Noblessner’s Valukoda. In addition to fashion designers and creatives, the event also acknowledges young promising film actors participating in the Black Nights Stars program. The event is part of the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event program for film professionals at the Black Nights Film Festival and the Creative Gate project funded by the European Regional Development Fund. PÖFF BlackWalk is supported by Enterprise Estonia, Toyota and Balmain Hair Couture Estonia.",

    "contents_en": "Black Nights Film Festival is proud to partner with FotoInMotion, a new tool that will automatically turn still images into immersive short-form videos. But what will be the future of tools for digital content creation? FotoInMotion partners will shed some light upon the trends!\n\n“Visual content” has become an all-encompassing category that can mean different things depending on who’s creating or consuming or selling it. Still most of us can agree about what is and what is not a photograph: whether printed or pixelated, color or black and white, fine art or breaking news or the sunset shot from your summer vacation.  \n\nAt the same time, of course, the digital revolution has changed everything. For better and worse. By most [estimates](https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/pilotonline.com/), more than one trillion images are taken a year, up from 80 billion in 2000. Our smartphones and social media mean anyone can be a published photographer — anywhere, anytime. That’s the good news and bad news. It’s bad news not only for those who try to make a living from it, but also for the rest of us who might not see the best or most relevant images in the constant stream of often mediocre (or pointless) photographs. \n\nStill, a whole [new generation](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/a-filmmaker-and-photographers-urgent-personal-portraits-of-harlem-at-night) of multimedia storytellers and technologists are helping to figure out how to take advantage of the opportunities the digital revolution offers photography. The advertising, entertainment, art and information industries are pushing the boundaries around 3D imaging, augmented reality, and new formats like [cinemagraphs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeI_w3qHU29/?taken-by=flixelphotos) that partially animate images. \n\nSome of it is pretty cool, but much of it is not really photography — that unique experience that a still image offers by capturing a moment, scene or something else that will never be quite the same. \n\n[FotoInMotion](https://fotoinmotion.eu/) is a new European Commission-backed project to build a digital tool to bridge the divide between the timeless power of photography and the new potential offered by information technology. The aim of the FotoInMotion tool is to use automation to efficiently turn any photograph into an immersive video for storytelling, journalistic and marketing purposes — a way to make great photographers come to life and transmit information in the endless stream of visual content.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/phstfK8wSmI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nThe FotoInMotion desktop and mobile tool will allow both creative content producers and the creative public to efficiently produce high-quality videos from still photography, relying on AI-driven automated editing functions and dynamic effects.\n\nBlack Night Film Festival is a key partner in the project, overseeing a major pilot program to test and exploit the tool during its annual festival. Over the coming weeks, there will be more articles from [FotoInMotion’s partners](https://fotoinmotion.eu/partners/), who hail from six industry sectors and six different European countries, exploring what it means to be a visual storyteller. And what it means to be a photograph.\n\n",

    "contents_en": "TV Beats Forum, a part of [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://poff.ee/) is the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event conference. The forum reacts to the real demand of the industry as a drama series’ market takes over and the need, for content by global streaming platforms increases. Local stories can travel universally as language barriers are no longer a problem and authenticity rules over generic and universal.\n\nTV Beats Forum is the place to meet the key international players in the region. Starting from small steps from 2018, with a one-day programme, we have an aim to build a drama series co-production market in the coming years. The forum’s prime objective is to inspire and facilitate the entry of regional producers and service providers into the international series co-production industry. With this in mind, TV Beats Forum explores global success stories from multinational productions. Scriptwriters, directors, composers, producers will share their experience as well as tips and tricks for creating a successful drama series.

    "contents_en": "Among this year’s highlights of the TV Beats Forum is the case study of the highly acclaimed HBO series ***Chernobyl*** with the series Lithuanian co-producer UAB Baltic Film Services producer **Lineta Miseikyte** (production manager of Defiance, 2008). During the discussion, Miseikyte will provide the perspective from a local production house working with a major studio on a production that kept growing throughout and took place in three different jurisdictions simultaneously – the US, UK and Lithuania. \n\n**Marge Liiske**, head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented: “We are extremely excited to continue working with our regions creative talents. We are always seeking ways to improve local series production and storytelling, and to attract more international productions to shoot here. One of our long-term goals is to build a regional series content market in Tallinn primarily aimed at the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian countries (including Iceland) and Ukraine, similar to what we are doing with films in the Baltic Event co-production market.”\n\nAnother high-profile international co-production in focus this year is ***The Feed***, starring David Thewlis and Michelle Fairley and written by Channing Powell (producer of *Walking Dead*). The series premiered in the UK via Virgin Media in September and will be available on Amazon Prime elsewhere. Three all3media international representatives – Executive Vice President of EMEA & European Co-Productions **Stephen Driscoll**, Acquisitions Executive **Laura White** and Sales Manager **Debra Bergg** – will be sharing their experience on working with the four companies that were involved in production: Studio Lambert in association with all3media international, Liberty Global and Amazon. \n\nThe third case study highlights the growing efforts and successes of Finnish-Estonian co-production by focusing on the Finnish crime series ***All the Sins***, funded by Finnish telecommunication service provider Elisa that has recently opened its own VOD service as well. Speakers include series creator/writer **Mika Ronkainen** (was co-created and co-written with Merja Aakko), producer **Ilkka Matila** and the Estonian co-producer **Kris Taska**. \n\nAlso among the speakers at TV Beats Forum is Icelandic producer **Kristinn Thordarson** (Kristinn Þórðarson) explaining how the tiny isolated country has become a hotspot for international production and manages to create series that travel globally. Thordarson will be sharing her experience working on ***The Valhalla Murders***, the first series that Netflix has produced in Iceland.\n\nThis year’s TV Beats Forum also tackles VOD content creation in Russia. The discussion round welcomes the team behind the new series ***Call Center***, as the creators **Natasha Merkulova** and **Alexey Chupov** (directors of the 2018 Venice Official Competition entry *The Man Who Surprised Everyone*) and producers **Valeriy Fedorovich** and **Evgeniy Nikishov** from Premier Studios (behind series Gogol and *An Ordinary Woman*, which have screened in the festival’s TV Beats programme previously) are confirmed as speakers. Call center follows employees of an online sex-shop, who find themselves shut inside their office by terrorists, who call themselves “Mommy and Daddy”. \n\n**TV Beats Forum** is the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event conference programme held during [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://2019.poff.ee/), reacting to the real demand of the industry as the series market is taking over from film, and the demand for content by global streaming platforms is ever increasing.\n\nTV Beats Forum will take place on **November 25 and 26, 2019**. Over the two days, various discussion panels, keynote interviews, presentations and workshops, as well as crossmatching events with other Industry@Tallinn activities will take place. \n\n[Check out the full programme of TV Beats Forum](https://industry.poff.ee/tv-beats-forum-2/) with intriguing discussion panels, case studies and fireside chats.\n\n",

    "contents_en": "Black Nights Film Festival is proud to partner with FotoInMotion, a new tool that will automatically turn still images into immersive short-form videos. But what will be the future of tools for digital content creation? FotoInMotion partners will shed some light upon the trends!\n\n“Visual content” has become an all-encompassing category that can mean different things depending on who’s creating or consuming or selling it. Still most of us can agree about what is and what is not a photograph: whether printed or pixelated, color or black and white, fine art or breaking news or the sunset shot from your summer vacation.  \n\nAt the same time, of course, the digital revolution has changed everything. For better and worse. By most [estimates](https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/pilotonline.com/), more than one trillion images are taken a year, up from 80 billion in 2000. Our smartphones and social media mean anyone can be a published photographer — anywhere, anytime. That’s the good news and bad news. It’s bad news not only for those who try to make a living from it, but also for the rest of us who might not see the best or most relevant images in the constant stream of often mediocre (or pointless) photographs. \n\nStill, a whole [new generation](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/a-filmmaker-and-photographers-urgent-personal-portraits-of-harlem-at-night) of multimedia storytellers and technologists are helping to figure out how to take advantage of the opportunities the digital revolution offers photography. The advertising, entertainment, art and information industries are pushing the boundaries around 3D imaging, augmented reality, and new formats like [cinemagraphs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeI_w3qHU29/?taken-by=flixelphotos) that partially animate images. \n\nSome of it is pretty cool, but much of it is not really photography — that unique experience that a still image offers by capturing a moment, scene or something else that will never be quite the same. \n\n[FotoInMotion](https://fotoinmotion.eu/) is a new European Commission-backed project to build a digital tool to bridge the divide between the timeless power of photography and the new potential offered by information technology. The aim of the FotoInMotion tool is to use automation to efficiently turn any photograph into an immersive video for storytelling, journalistic and marketing purposes — a way to make great photographers come to life and transmit information in the endless stream of visual content.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/phstfK8wSmI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nThe FotoInMotion desktop and mobile tool will allow both creative content producers and the creative public to efficiently produce high-quality videos from still photography, relying on AI-driven automated editing functions and dynamic effects.\n\nBlack Night Film Festival is a key partner in the project, overseeing a major pilot program to test and exploit the tool during its annual festival. Over the coming weeks, there will be more articles from [FotoInMotion’s partners](https://fotoinmotion.eu/partners/), who hail from six industry sectors and six different European countries, exploring what it means to be a visual storyteller. And what it means to be a photograph.\n\n",

        "aboutText": "If someone were to be replaced in place of Werther, Antoni would be among the nominees.\nHis naive look at reality can attract the audience. He proved that as he played parts in Dywizjon 303 “Historia Prawdziwa” by Denis Delić, and “Legiony” by Dariusz Gajewski.\nRaised at the farm ploughing the field, he has been developing his skills (including acting) for years while doing his best at every production he took part in. Speaking of which, Antoni fluently speaks English and French. His language skills had an overtone in productions such as BREAKING THE BAND season II: GUNS’N’ROSES by Zoran Trajkovic; 7 GODZIN W POCIĄGU by Miguel Velez.\nOne of his adventures inspired him to learn Russian, and he managed to train figure ice skating at age 23 (with a little help of ballet). \nWorth mentioning is also his part in epic series “Korona Królów” where his creation of Skirgaila – Polish king’s brother met with the best reception. As important as attracting the audience, Antoni also did his best in preparation with history interview, medieval swordfight, and horse riding. \nIn his acting journey, he also met with Oscar-nominated direction Bartosz Konopka in Netflix Original series “The Woods”.",

The explosive shock, unprecedented in its breadth and impact, has not only imploded the full value chain of cinema but has brought to the forefront the most significant challenges the medium and the industry has faced since its birth – whichever angle one takes.\n\nThe European independent sector has witnessed perhaps the hardest, with all but a few significant festivals canceled, productions suspended, and distribution chains are broken with cinemas and audiences coping with on the national lockdown fronts.\n\nFrom a global perspective, perhaps 2020 has been the best year ever for watching, with accounts showing a tremendous spike in the consumption of audiovisual content and a staggering 79% increase in streaming hours, leading some of the super players to gap the quality of their services.\n\nAs paradoxical it might seem, the global COVID epidemic has not derailed the film industry by surprise as many would love to believe, but savagely accelerated the already current transformation processes. For a fact, few players emerging with the bounty while many are jogging dazedly behind.\n\nThus, the new playbook for a new normal is here – the question is how to define opportunities, strategies, and best practices and transform fast with foresight and resilience before it’s too late.\n\nThe European Film Forum, as a debate and discussion platform on the future evolution of European cinema and film industry, will return to Tallinn on November 23, 2020, with a half a day virtual and hybrid summit of executive-level debates, case studies, and showcases on the most pressing topics for the European film, television, and content industry at the time of COVID.\n\n**The focus themes of the 2020 edition are:**\n\n- The new industry leadership playbook at the time of COVID19 Pandemic – how to transform successfully through resilience and foresight\n- Redefining windows and rights: a time for European film distribution and exhibition value chain 2.0\n- Reaching the audience during a lockdown: A deep dive into the best practices of VOD, Livestreaming, Watch Parties and Alternative Distribution\n- Reimagining Film Festivals during lockdown: How have festivals adapted, failed, or succeeded and how to define the future role of the festivals at the European level and beyond\n- European Frontieres: The public-private model and European Copyright Infrastructure as an example of future European catalyst\n\nJoin the half-day hybrid and virtual summit and debate, learn, and network with 100+ European and global industry executives, entrepreneurs, and policymakers shaping European cinema’s future.\n\nThe European Film Forum is organized by the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and Industry Tallinn by the European Commission's mandate.

As always this was a very difficult decision: several of the projects displayed extremely high levels of craft and attainment from teams who were collaborative and determined always to keep pushing themselves. But one stood out for having achieved those craft objectives, but which also displayed an additional spark of personal passion and the courage to explore difficult and controversial modern topics with great honesty.

        "aboutText": "I was born in 1999 in the south of Germany, Freiburg, as the son of an australian painter and an art managing mother. Through a rough but lovely childhood, I got interest in acting. After being part of Stage Entertainment Musical \"Tarzan\" for one year, I entered my first acting agency and started to shoot first small movies. At the same time I went to a Waldorf School, which allowed me to get more deeply into acting. As I got older, I was allowed to shoot more bigger movies and tv-productions that helped me to get finally engaged into acting as a professional career.  I went to an acting school (\"New Talent Schauspielschule\") for two years, changed the agency, and continued my way. I just made the decision, and succeeded to be applied for 2021 to the highly profiled acting school, Hochschule für Musik und Theater Leipzig, to graduate as Master of Arts in four years. Besides acting, I can restore my energy and balance in traveling by myself, experiencing culture and sports. My favourite destination is a farm in Algarve, Potugal, where my godson lives. At least once a year I get engaged in the daily working life of farming, supporting the family and being part of an international community. ",

He proved that as he played parts in Dywizjon 303 “Historia Prawdziwa” by Denis Delić, and “Legiony” by Dariusz Gajewski.\nRaised at the farm ploughing the field, he has been developing his skills (including acting) for years while doing his best at every production he took part in. Speaking of which, Antoni fluently speaks English and French. His language skills had an overtone in productions such as BREAKING THE BAND season II: GUNS’N’ROSES by Zoran Trajkovic; 7 GODZIN W POCIĄGU by Miguel Velez.\nOne of his adventures inspired him to learn Russian, and he managed to train figure ice skating at age 23 (with a little help of ballet). \nWorth mentioning is also his part in epic series “Korona Królów” where his creation of Skirgaila – Polish king’s brother met with the best reception. As important as attracting the audience, Antoni also did his best in preparation with history interview, medieval swordfight, and horse riding. \nIn his acting journey, he also met with Oscar-nominated direction Bartosz Konopka in Netflix Original series “The Woods”.",

I studied theatre and acting in the University of Tartu Viljandi Culture Academy and graduated in 2019. ​\nBesides acting I have also studied yoga and herbal medicine and could also be found behind the DJ decks. ​ As an artist, I am into growth and progress. I would like to collaborate in projects that can open new perspectives and expand my experience and methods as an actress. It is important to me that the work I do has something to say and improve in our society and environment. I believe that a work of art can and should touch the audience, widen their perception, and make a difference in their heart and in their mind.\nBefore my studies as an actress, I was devoted to dancing for four years, which has made me fond of the idea of working on projects that are also connected with dance, choreography or martial arts. ​\nI think I am quite adventurous, love experimenting, facing challenges and making mistakes. I do my work with love and so it never feels like work to me.",

I studied theatre and acting in the University of Tartu Viljandi Culture Academy and graduated in 2019. ​\nBesides acting I have also studied yoga and herbal medicine and could also be found behind the DJ decks. ​ As an artist, I am into growth and progress. I would like to collaborate in projects that can open new perspectives and expand my experience and methods as an actress. It is important to me that the work I do has something to say and improve in our society and environment. I believe that a work of art can and should touch the audience, widen their perception, and make a difference in their heart and in their mind.\nBefore my studies as an actress, I was devoted to dancing for four years, which has made me fond of the idea of working on projects that are also connected with dance, choreography or martial arts. ​\nI think I am quite adventurous, love experimenting, facing challenges and making mistakes. I do my work with love and so it never feels like work to me.",

    "contents_en": "Among this year’s highlights of the TV Beats Forum is the case study of the highly acclaimed HBO series ***Chernobyl*** with the series Lithuanian co-producer UAB Baltic Film Services producer **Lineta Miseikyte** (production manager of Defiance, 2008). During the discussion, Miseikyte will provide the perspective from a local production house working with a major studio on a production that kept growing throughout and took place in three different jurisdictions simultaneously – the US, UK and Lithuania. \n\n**Marge Liiske**, head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented: “We are extremely excited to continue working with our regions creative talents. We are always seeking ways to improve local series production and storytelling, and to attract more international productions to shoot here. One of our long-term goals is to build a regional series content market in Tallinn primarily aimed at the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian countries (including Iceland) and Ukraine, similar to what we are doing with films in the Baltic Event co-production market.”\n\nAnother high-profile international co-production in focus this year is ***The Feed***, starring David Thewlis and Michelle Fairley and written by Channing Powell (producer of *Walking Dead*). The series premiered in the UK via Virgin Media in September and will be available on Amazon Prime elsewhere. Three all3media international representatives – Executive Vice President of EMEA & European Co-Productions **Stephen Driscoll**, Acquisitions Executive **Laura White** and Sales Manager **Debra Bergg** – will be sharing their experience on working with the four companies that were involved in production: Studio Lambert in association with all3media international, Liberty Global and Amazon. \n\nThe third case study highlights the growing efforts and successes of Finnish-Estonian co-production by focusing on the Finnish crime series ***All the Sins***, funded by Finnish telecommunication service provider Elisa that has recently opened its own VOD service as well. Speakers include series creator/writer **Mika Ronkainen** (was co-created and co-written with Merja Aakko), producer **Ilkka Matila** and the Estonian co-producer **Kris Taska**. \n\nAlso among the speakers at TV Beats Forum is Icelandic producer **Kristinn Thordarson** (Kristinn Þórðarson) explaining how the tiny isolated country has become a hotspot for international production and manages to create series that travel globally. Thordarson will be sharing her experience working on ***The Valhalla Murders***, the first series that Netflix has produced in Iceland.\n\nThis year’s TV Beats Forum also tackles VOD content creation in Russia. The discussion round welcomes the team behind the new series ***Call Center***, as the creators **Natasha Merkulova** and **Alexey Chupov** (directors of the 2018 Venice Official Competition entry *The Man Who Surprised Everyone*) and producers **Valeriy Fedorovich** and **Evgeniy Nikishov** from Premier Studios (behind series Gogol and *An Ordinary Woman*, which have screened in the festival’s TV Beats programme previously) are confirmed as speakers. Call center follows employees of an online sex-shop, who find themselves shut inside their office by terrorists, who call themselves “Mommy and Daddy”. \n\n**TV Beats Forum** is the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event conference programme held during [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://2019.poff.ee/), reacting to the real demand of the industry as the series market is taking over from film, and the demand for content by global streaming platforms is ever increasing.\n\nTV Beats Forum will take place on **November 25 and 26, 2019**. Over the two days, various discussion panels, keynote interviews, presentations and workshops, as well as crossmatching events with other Industry@Tallinn activities will take place. \n\n[Check out the full programme of TV Beats Forum](https://industry.poff.ee/tv-beats-forum-2/) with intriguing discussion panels, case studies and fireside chats.\n\n",

As always this was a very difficult decision: several of the projects displayed extremely high levels of craft and attainment from teams who were collaborative and determined always to keep pushing themselves. But one stood out for having achieved those craft objectives, but which also displayed an additional spark of personal passion and the courage to explore difficult and controversial modern topics with great honesty. A writer’s job is to explore an issue, not to preach about it – and for that reason the winner of this years’ HBO Europe prize is AFTERPARTY.“ \n\n**SCRIPT POOL TALLINN 2020**\n\nScript Pool Film and TV Award for is given to an outstanding script in Film and TV series category (a 5 000 EUR). \n\n**Script Pool Film Award** \n\nWinner: [*20,000 Species of Bees*](https://industry.poff.ee/project/20-000-species-of-bees/)\nScreenwriter Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren \nProduction company: Gariza Films and Sirimiri Films.

The explosive shock, unprecedented in its breadth and impact, has not only imploded the full value chain of cinema but has brought to the forefront the most significant challenges the medium and the industry has faced since its birth – whichever angle one takes.\n\nThe European independent sector has witnessed perhaps the hardest, with all but a few significant festivals canceled, productions suspended, and distribution chains are broken with cinemas and audiences coping with on the national lockdown fronts.\n\nFrom a global perspective, perhaps 2020 has been the best year ever for watching, with accounts showing a tremendous spike in the consumption of audiovisual content and a staggering 79% increase in streaming hours, leading some of the super players to gap the quality of their services.\n\nAs paradoxical it might seem, the global COVID epidemic has not derailed the film industry by surprise as many would love to believe, but savagely accelerated the already current transformation processes.

        "aboutText": "I was born in 1999 in the south of Germany, Freiburg, as the son of an australian painter and an art managing mother. Through a rough but lovely childhood, I got interest in acting. After being part of Stage Entertainment Musical \"Tarzan\" for one year, I entered my first acting agency and started to shoot first small movies. At the same time I went to a Waldorf School, which allowed me to get more deeply into acting. As I got older, I was allowed to shoot more bigger movies and tv-productions that helped me to get finally engaged into acting as a professional career.  I went to an acting school (\"New Talent Schauspielschule\") for two years, changed the agency, and continued my way. I just made the decision, and succeeded to be applied for 2021 to the highly profiled acting school, Hochschule für Musik und Theater Leipzig, to graduate as Master of Arts in four years. Besides acting, I can restore my energy and balance in traveling by myself, experiencing culture and sports. My favourite destination is a farm in Algarve, Potugal, where my godson lives. At least once a year I get engaged in the daily working life of farming, supporting the family and being part of an international community. ",

The aim of the event was to increase the number of people and companies that could start creating various products using multidimensional audiovisual solutions (VR, AR, XR, etc.) in the future. Although the growing demand for VR competencies and services is growing in Estonia, the number of companies offering such services is less than five.\n\nRein Zobel was the main mentor of the event. In addition to the projects and products developed by his company Maru VR, he is also a visiting lecturer of the VR lecture series at Tallinn University. In addition three more mentors attended the event in Talllinn and lifted the level of competence. Nimrod Shanit (Israel), Mitya Sorkin (Belarus) and Angel Urbina Vitoria (Spain) are all leading players in the field of creating virtual reality content in their respective countries.\n\nIn addition to mentoring the workshop, all guests presented an hour-long case study, explaining their experiences and what opportunities they thought virtual reality offered in the future.\n\nParticipants had access to a variety of 360-degree cameras, sound and lighting equipment, a post-production specialist, both mobile and computer compatible VR-headsets, and the whole Proto Invention Centre. The first day was mainly spent on the basics, theory, brainstorming, and forming groups. The second day began with a shooting period, followed by post-production, individual mentoring, and viewing the results with VR-headsets.\n\n![ind-virtualreality1.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality1_c22820ab8d.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality2.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality2_20b274e421.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality3.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality3_ec94a968fb.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality4.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality4_7801f933cb.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality5.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality5_85ee32d631.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality6.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality6_52df1f849a.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality7.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality7_a41a5ddcc8.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality8.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality8_5ae8e561ca.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality9.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality9_a4bb6a0b1e.jpg)\n\n",

    "contents_en": "Leana Jalukse, Co-Production Market Manager, said that despite the unexpectedly difficult year for the film industry and everyone in general, they were pleasantly surprised to receive the same amount of submissions as always with the quality rising ever higher. “We are thrilled to see that producers from high production capacity countries such as France and Germany are looking towards our territories for co-production opportunities. The themes, as always, come across the spectrum, and we are happy to support rising talent by showcasing a number of debut features – all by talented filmmakers who have won numerous awards for their short films,” she added. \n\n*Aliya* from Israel by debut director Dekel Berenson follows the journey of a young Ukrainian woman of Jewish heritage training to become an instructor in the Israeli army. *Soldier*, another feature debut by the Finnish filmmaker Toni Kamula deals with the aftermath of moral dilemmas and blurred lines in war situations.  \n\nThe lineup continues with two projects portraying difficulties faced by refugees – *Apathy*, France, by award-winning Greek filmmaker Alexandros Avranas, reveals the grim reality of a syndrome suffered by refugee children, while *Dogborn*, Sweden, the third debut by writer-director Isabella Carbonell features the impossible choice faced by two teenage refugees – smuggle children even younger than themselves or starve. \n\nFrom Sweden, BE Co-Production Market also presents *Kevlar Soul*, a family drama dealing with addiction, by the short film team, director Maria Eriksson-Hecht and producer Ronnie Fritsche, Zentropa. Drugs are also the main subject of another family drama, *Class A from Ireland*, BE’s former focus country, by our fourth debutant Brian Durnin.\n\nMoving on to two dramas involving children, the first Filipino project, *Ninja from Manila*, is an adventure story of grief and acceptance by the experienced duo writer-director Miko Livelo and producer Alemberg Ang. *Milk Teeth*, a debut by Mihai Mincan from Romania, is a much darker story, involving the kidnapping and murder of a little girl. Another experienced team comes from Latvia – director Davis Simanis and producer Gints Grube present *Maria’s Silence*, their next historical drama based on true events.\n\nLithuania’s project *Tasty* brings some lightness to our selection. Egle Vertelyte and Lukas Trimonis team up for their second feature, after participating in B’EST EAVE 2013 and going to screen their debut Miracle at over 50 festivals. \n\nBaltic Event’s home country is this year represented by Oscar-nominated producer Ivo Felt’s next project *Eight Views of Lake Biwa* by director Marko Raat.

The aim of the event was to increase the number of people and companies that could start creating various products using multidimensional audiovisual solutions (VR, AR, XR, etc.) in the future. Although the growing demand for VR competencies and services is growing in Estonia, the number of companies offering such services is less than five.\n\nRein Zobel was the main mentor of the event. In addition to the projects and products developed by his company Maru VR, he is also a visiting lecturer of the VR lecture series at Tallinn University. In addition three more mentors attended the event in Talllinn and lifted the level of competence. Nimrod Shanit (Israel), Mitya Sorkin (Belarus) and Angel Urbina Vitoria (Spain) are all leading players in the field of creating virtual reality content in their respective countries.\n\nIn addition to mentoring the workshop, all guests presented an hour-long case study, explaining their experiences and what opportunities they thought virtual reality offered in the future.\n\nParticipants had access to a variety of 360-degree cameras, sound and lighting equipment, a post-production specialist, both mobile and computer compatible VR-headsets, and the whole Proto Invention Centre. The first day was mainly spent on the basics, theory, brainstorming, and forming groups. The second day began with a shooting period, followed by post-production, individual mentoring, and viewing the results with VR-headsets.\n\n![ind-virtualreality1.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality1_c22820ab8d.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality2.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality2_20b274e421.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality3.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality3_ec94a968fb.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality4.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality4_7801f933cb.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality5.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality5_85ee32d631.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality6.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality6_52df1f849a.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality7.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality7_a41a5ddcc8.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality8.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality8_5ae8e561ca.jpg)\n![ind-virtualreality9.jpg](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/ind_virtualreality9_a4bb6a0b1e.jpg)\n\n",

    "contents_en": "As this year’s Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event takes place fully online, the presentations of projects taking part of Works in Progress can be followed on the industry.poff.ee website. The projects will be presented on November, 24.   \n\nThe projects presented at Baltic Event, showcasing Baltic and Finnish films, and projects presented in International Works in Progress categories, all compete for the Post Production Award by Post Control, a Helsinki based high-end post-production house, in the amount of 10 000 EUR and the Baltic Event Works in Progress Award in the amount of 3 000 EUR.  \n\nThe jury consists of Isabel Ivars-Sancho (Films Boutique), Ilaria Gomarasca (First Cut +) and Nikolaj Nikitin (Director and Head of Studies, School of Film Advancement, Artistic Director at International Film Festival Prague / Febiofest). The jury will hand out the Awards on November 26 at the Awards Ceremony. \n\n#### Baltic Event Works in Progress showcases the good health of regional film industry  \n\nBaltic Event Works in Progress, taking place for the 18th time in 2020, showcases seven promising projects from the Baltics and Finland. \n\nMaria Ulfsak, the Project Manager of Works in Progress Baltic Events said that they were happy that, even though the industry events are taking place online, there were still a lot of interesting projects applying to participate in Works in Progress programs. “The projects in the Baltic Event Works in Progress selection this year are very different, from a 3-million budget historical adventure film to smaller, edgier and more experimental projects. This shows the good health of the regional film industry – very different films are in production and post-production and even though the virus has affected us all, the future looks bright. Hopefully we can all meet in person in wintry Tallinn next year,” she added \n\nThis year, **Estonia** is represented with two projects at **Baltic Event Works in Progress**. Sports drama ***Kalev***, from director Ove Musting, tells the story of  Estonian national basketball team Kalev and their unpopular decision to take part of the USSR’s championships in the summer of 1990, with the Soviet Union on the verge of collapse. The mystical ***Melchior The Apothecary***, directed by Elmo Nüganen, takes place in medieval Tallinn, where Melchior Wakenstede, a clever and curious apothecary who, in addition to healing the sick, solves murders that shake the town.  \n\nBaltic Event Works in Progress also includes two projects from **Latvia** – the drama ***Lovable*** by director Stanislavs Tokalovs that unveils the story of Matiss and ten-year-old Stasija, who unexpectedly have lost their partner and mother. ***Neon Spring***, a new project by Matīss Kaža focuses on a 20-year old girl, Laine, who starts to question her sexuality and identity while her family is falling apart. \n\n**Lithuania** is represented by two projects this year. A dramedy, ***I Am Fine, Thanks***, from Ernestas Jankauskas tells the story of a woman coming back to her former life after checking herself out of a rehabilitation clinic. A drama ***Feature Film About Life*** by Dovilė Šarutytė follows a story of a girl, Dovile, after her father’s death: as money is short, she decides to reject the professional funeral services and to organize the funeral herself.  \n\nIn addition to projects from Baltics, **Finland** is presented with a drama ***A Girl’s Room*** by Aino Suni. The story unrolls as 17-year-old aspiring rapper Elina is forced to leave Finland and move to the South of France, where her mother’s boyfriend lives and where she soon meets her new stepsister Sofia. \n\n#### International Works in Progress   \n\nThe sixth International Works in Progress presents seven projects from all around the world.  \n\nShahar Rozen from Israel presents fiction feature ***Ducks, Urban Legend***. Psychological drama ***The Anger***, directed and produced by Maria Ivanova Z is a joint project of Lebanon and Germany. Olesya Morgunets-Isaenko, from Ukraine, presents her first feature ***Carol of the Bells***. Representing the other side of the globe, Natalia Cabral and Oriol Estrada from the Dominican Republic showcase ***A Film About Couples***. \n\nAs in 2020 Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event introduces Russia in Focus, there are also three projects from Russia presented at International Works in Progress – dramas, including ***Nuuccha***, the first feature by director and screenwriter Vladimir Munkuev, another first feature –  ***First Snow*** by Nathalia Konchalovsky and  ***Zemun*** by Eduard Zholnin.  \n\n#### Just Film Works in Progress \n\nFor the second time, Works in Progress also presents projects in the children and youth film category. In 2020 there are four projects competing for the Just Film award – 1000 EUR to help the film gain visibility by covering promotion and publicity costs. \n\nThe jury of Just Film Works in Progress consists of Olaf Wehowsky (festival manager of LUCAS – International Festival for Young Film Lovers, Germany), Per Erikson (manager of the Swedish Federation of Film Societies, Sweden) and Guy Davies (film director /Philophobia/, UK)\n\n***A Butterfly’s Heart*** is a feature from award-winning Lithuanian director Inesa Kurklietytė, who was named The International Film Festival Serseliafam’s  “Woman of the Year in Cinema”. Jaak Kilmi, a director from Estonia presents his newest project ***The Sleeping Beast***. A joint coproduction from Belgium, the Netherlands and France, ***This is My Moment*** is a creative documentary by Lieven Corthouts, a self-taught filmmaker focused on directing documentaries, and ***New Wonder***, directed by Alexandra Strelyanaya, represents Focus on Russia in the Just Film Works in Progress category. \n\n",

    "contents_en": "The case study will focus on the independent production *Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway* by director Miguel Llanso. The film has already gained attention and positive feedback at several festivals for genre films.\n\nMiguel Llanso’s second feature *Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway* is an absurd sci-fi action-comedy. The project started as a no-budget film, and gradually grew into a co-production between Spain, Estonia, Ethiopia, Latvia and Romania. The film was partly financed via crowdfunding. The storyline introduces CIA Agents Palmer and Gagano, who are tasked with the mission of destroying a computer virus called “Soviet Union”. \n\nLlanso, who is also employed as an associate professor at the Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School, will focus on development and production with limited resources.\n\nThe European Genre Forum (EGF) is an annual training programme that tries to boost the careers of future European players in the genre film industry. In 2019 EGF consists of two talent labs – The Producers Lab **in Zagreb** and The Packaging Lab **in Tallinn**. At the two-day Packaging Lab in Tallinn teams will focus on developing pitching skills, followed by public pitching at the Industry @ Tallinn & Baltic Event. \n\nEvery year, up to eight films will be selected by the European Genre Forum.

    "contents_en": "As this year’s Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event takes place fully online, the presentations of projects taking part of Works in Progress can be followed on the industry.poff.ee website. The projects will be presented on November, 24.   \n\nThe projects presented at Baltic Event, showcasing Baltic and Finnish films, and projects presented in International Works in Progress categories, all compete for the Post Production Award by Post Control, a Helsinki based high-end post-production house, in the amount of 10 000 EUR and the Baltic Event Works in Progress Award in the amount of 3 000 EUR.  \n\nThe jury consists of Isabel Ivars-Sancho (Films Boutique), Ilaria Gomarasca (First Cut +) and Nikolaj Nikitin (Director and Head of Studies, School of Film Advancement, Artistic Director at International Film Festival Prague / Febiofest). The jury will hand out the Awards on November 26 at the Awards Ceremony. \n\n#### Baltic Event Works in Progress showcases the good health of regional film industry  \n\nBaltic Event Works in Progress, taking place for the 18th time in 2020, showcases seven promising projects from the Baltics and Finland. \n\nMaria Ulfsak, the Project Manager of Works in Progress Baltic Events said that they were happy that, even though the industry events are taking place online, there were still a lot of interesting projects applying to participate in Works in Progress programs. “The projects in the Baltic Event Works in Progress selection this year are very different, from a 3-million budget historical adventure film to smaller, edgier and more experimental projects. This shows the good health of the regional film industry – very different films are in production and post-production and even though the virus has affected us all, the future looks bright. Hopefully we can all meet in person in wintry Tallinn next year,” she added \n\nThis year, **Estonia** is represented with two projects at **Baltic Event Works in Progress**. Sports drama ***Kalev***, from director Ove Musting, tells the story of  Estonian national basketball team Kalev and their unpopular decision to take part of the USSR’s championships in the summer of 1990, with the Soviet Union on the verge of collapse. The mystical ***Melchior The Apothecary***, directed by Elmo Nüganen, takes place in medieval Tallinn, where Melchior Wakenstede, a clever and curious apothecary who, in addition to healing the sick, solves murders that shake the town.  \n\nBaltic Event Works in Progress also includes two projects from **Latvia** – the drama ***Lovable*** by director Stanislavs Tokalovs that unveils the story of Matiss and ten-year-old Stasija, who unexpectedly have lost their partner and mother. ***Neon Spring***, a new project by Matīss Kaža focuses on a 20-year old girl, Laine, who starts to question her sexuality and identity while her family is falling apart. \n\n**Lithuania** is represented by two projects this year. A dramedy, ***I Am Fine, Thanks***, from Ernestas Jankauskas tells the story of a woman coming back to her former life after checking herself out of a rehabilitation clinic. A drama ***Feature Film About Life*** by Dovilė Šarutytė follows a story of a girl, Dovile, after her father’s death: as money is short, she decides to reject the professional funeral services and to organize the funeral herself.  \n\nIn addition to projects from Baltics, **Finland** is presented with a drama ***A Girl’s Room*** by Aino Suni. The story unrolls as 17-year-old aspiring rapper Elina is forced to leave Finland and move to the South of France, where her mother’s boyfriend lives and where she soon meets her new stepsister Sofia. \n\n#### International Works in Progress   \n\nThe sixth International Works in Progress presents seven projects from all around the world.  \n\nShahar Rozen from Israel presents fiction feature ***Ducks, Urban Legend***. Psychological drama ***The Anger***, directed and produced by Maria Ivanova Z is a joint project of Lebanon and Germany. Olesya Morgunets-Isaenko, from Ukraine, presents her first feature ***Carol of the Bells***. Representing the other side of the globe, Natalia Cabral and Oriol Estrada from the Dominican Republic showcase ***A Film About Couples***. \n\nAs in 2020 Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event introduces Russia in Focus, there are also three projects from Russia presented at International Works in Progress – dramas, including ***Nuuccha***, the first feature by director and screenwriter Vladimir Munkuev, another first feature –  ***First Snow*** by Nathalia Konchalovsky and  ***Zemun*** by Eduard Zholnin.  \n\n#### Just Film Works in Progress \n\nFor the second time, Works in Progress also presents projects in the children and youth film category. In 2020 there are four projects competing for the Just Film award – 1000 EUR to help the film gain visibility by covering promotion and publicity costs. \n\nThe jury of Just Film Works in Progress consists of Olaf Wehowsky (festival manager of LUCAS – International Festival for Young Film Lovers, Germany), Per Erikson (manager of the Swedish Federation of Film Societies, Sweden) and Guy Davies (film director /Philophobia/, UK)\n\n***A Butterfly’s Heart*** is a feature from award-winning Lithuanian director Inesa Kurklietytė, who was named The International Film Festival Serseliafam’s  “Woman of the Year in Cinema”. Jaak Kilmi, a director from Estonia presents his newest project ***The Sleeping Beast***. A joint coproduction from Belgium, the Netherlands and France, ***This is My Moment*** is a creative documentary by Lieven Corthouts, a self-taught filmmaker focused on directing documentaries, and ***New Wonder***, directed by Alexandra Strelyanaya, represents Focus on Russia in the Just Film Works in Progress category. \n\n",

As always this was a very difficult decision: several of the projects displayed extremely high levels of craft and attainment from teams who were collaborative and determined always to keep pushing themselves. But one stood out for having achieved those craft objectives, but which also displayed an additional spark of personal passion and the courage to explore difficult and controversial modern topics with great honesty. A writer’s job is to explore an issue, not to preach about it – and for that reason the winner of this years’ HBO Europe prize is AFTERPARTY.“\n\nMIDPOINT TV Launch is realized with the support of the Creative Europe – MEDIA Programme of the European Union, the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic, the Czech Film Fund and the Slovak Audiovisual Fund.

        "aboutText": "In 1999, Gabor heard the siren call of TV drama and ended up on the writing staff of a daily soap at Grundy UFA. Having emerged to the level of story editor, he burnt out quickly and left after 4 years of hard labour. Based on his experiences, he wrote a book on TV writing and was subsequently invited to teach scriptwriting and dramaturgy at various institutions, among them the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest. In 2006, he co-founded a script consulting firm and spent the following years as a hired gun, doing script editing and writing.\nGabor was offered the job of script development executive at the fledgling Local Original Production department at the Budapest office of HBO Europe in 2010. He later became the Creative Executive, responsible for all creative aspects of development and production on all Hungarian HBO shows as a producer, the latest being the third season of Golden Life, a crime thriller/family drama. In this role, he had also assisted in the launch of original production for HBO Europe in the Adria region.\nAfter leaving HBO at the end of 2018, Gabor went on to found his own company, Joyrider, specializing in creating and developing high-end scripted serial content for the international market.",

        "aboutText": "After studying drama at Bristol University, Ben’s first industry job was as a runner at ITV Studios Drama. Subsequently, Ben became Assistant to the Creative Director and he’d only recently made the leap to Junior Script Editor when a show he was assisting on was greenlit by ITV/PBS.\nThis show was Mr Selfridge (10x60). Ben became part of the original creative team that set up the series and its writers' room alongside creator Andrew Davies. He went on to oversee the script process on all four seasons as Script Editor/Executive, eventually writing his own episode in the final season.\nSoon after, Ben worked with show-runner Kate Brooke to set up contemporary crime thriller Bancroft (4x60 for ITV) which ran for two seasons. Ben was Script Executive/Story Consultant and co-wrote three episodes with Kate across both seasons.\nAs Development Executive, Ben recently oversaw the development and story of Sarah Williams' family mystery drama Flesh and Blood, starring Imelda Staunton, which premiered this February on ITV1. Most recently, he wrote an episode of Kate O'Riordan's new Channel 5 psychological drama Penance, which became one of the highest-rated dramas ever on the channel in March 2020.",

Having emerged to the level of story editor, he burnt out quickly and left after 4 years of hard labour. Based on his experiences, he wrote a book on TV writing and was subsequently invited to teach scriptwriting and dramaturgy at various institutions, among them the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest. In 2006, he co-founded a script consulting firm and spent the following years as a hired gun, doing script editing and writing.\nGabor was offered the job of script development executive at the fledgling Local Original Production department at the Budapest office of HBO Europe in 2010. He later became the Creative Executive, responsible for all creative aspects of development and production on all Hungarian HBO shows as a producer, the latest being the third season of Golden Life, a crime thriller/family drama. In this role, he had also assisted in the launch of original production for HBO Europe in the Adria region.\nAfter leaving HBO at the end of 2018, Gabor went on to found his own company, Joyrider, specializing in creating and developing high-end scripted serial content for the international market.",

Subsequently, Ben became Assistant to the Creative Director and he’d only recently made the leap to Junior Script Editor when a show he was assisting on was greenlit by ITV/PBS.\nThis show was Mr Selfridge (10x60). Ben became part of the original creative team that set up the series and its writers' room alongside creator Andrew Davies. He went on to oversee the script process on all four seasons as Script Editor/Executive, eventually writing his own episode in the final season.\nSoon after, Ben worked with show-runner Kate Brooke to set up contemporary crime thriller Bancroft (4x60 for ITV) which ran for two seasons. Ben was Script Executive/Story Consultant and co-wrote three episodes with Kate across both seasons.\nAs Development Executive, Ben recently oversaw the development and story of Sarah Williams' family mystery drama Flesh and Blood, starring Imelda Staunton, which premiered this February on ITV1. Most recently, he wrote an episode of Kate O'Riordan's new Channel 5 psychological drama Penance, which became one of the highest-rated dramas ever on the channel in March 2020.",

    "contents_en": "The case study will focus on the independent production *Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway* by director Miguel Llanso. The film has already gained attention and positive feedback at several festivals for genre films.\n\nMiguel Llanso’s second feature *Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway* is an absurd sci-fi action-comedy. The project started as a no-budget film, and gradually grew into a co-production between Spain, Estonia, Ethiopia, Latvia and Romania. The film was partly financed via crowdfunding. The storyline introduces CIA Agents Palmer and Gagano, who are tasked with the mission of destroying a computer virus called “Soviet Union”. \n\nLlanso, who is also employed as an associate professor at the Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School, will focus on development and production with limited resources.\n\nThe European Genre Forum (EGF) is an annual training programme that tries to boost the careers of future European players in the genre film industry. In 2019 EGF consists of two talent labs – The Producers Lab **in Zagreb** and The Packaging Lab **in Tallinn**. At the two-day Packaging Lab in Tallinn teams will focus on developing pitching skills, followed by public pitching at the Industry @ Tallinn & Baltic Event. \n\nEvery year, up to eight films will be selected by the European Genre Forum. The projects participating in this years’ programme include Lemnos (France), Utopya (Switzerland), Tracking: The Cyprus Tiger (Cyprus), Hospice (UK), Mirror of Nightingales (Croatia), Naked Coast (Poland) and Children of the Gods (Serbia). From previous editions of EGF, taking place for the third time, a Finnish project Hatching has reached the production stage and will be finished by 2021.  European Genre Forum is a pan-European project organised by [Black Nights Film Festival](https://2018.poff.ee/) from Tallinn; [Imagine Film Festival](http://www.imaginefilmfestival.com/) from Amsterdam and the [Fantastic Zagreb Film Festival](http://2018.fantastic-zagreb.com/).\n\nTallinn Lab is supported by ARRI Media. The call for projects for 2020 will open later in December.\n\n",

The curfews have halted the whole lifecycle from production to festivals and markets, theatres, and digital releases alike and heated already strenuous relations between the studios, platforms, and theatres.\n\nWith an estimated more than half a million industry members unemployed across the world, it is clear that the recovery for the film industry will be long and will require fresh blood and brains across the board. But how is the Genre industry doing which always has been the bad kid with “out of the box” mentality when it comes to content, financing, production, and squeezing the latest promotional or tech gimmicks to the max to gets the thrills to the viewers?\n\nWith a few major festivals such as SXSW and Fantastia Festival down, but half of the genre’s A-listers such as Neuchatel and Bifan (South Korea) on its feet, and the viewers locked to their VOD offerings, could the genre circuit have a more robust change to emergence from the crisis as an unexpected winner?\n\n[European Genre Forum](https://europeangenreforum.com/) training programme and [Haapsalu Fantastic Film Festival](https://hoff.ee/en/) HOFF of the [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://poff.ee/en/) invite you to join the season’s first **digital deep dive into the state of the genre business to dissect how the industry is reacting to the COVID lockdown and what the community can do and is already doing to keep the blood rushing and the business kicking!**  Bringing together a festival director, a market runner financier, a duo of acclaimed independent producers and a sales agent, the digital Videodrome will see explore what will become of the festival and market circuit, has genre invaded the VOD and what to make or make not of the digital’s giants entry to the indie streaming landscape?\n\n#### Panelists:\n\nAnnick Mahnert – Director, Frontieres co-production market (SP/CAN)\n\nTodd Brown – Partner, XYZ Films (tbc) (CAN/USA)\n\nBrian Yuzna – Producer, “Reanimator” (USA)\n\nBrendan McCarthy – Screenwriter, Producer “Vivarium” (IR)\n\nMoritz Hemminger – Deputy Head of Sales & Acquisitions, Arri MEDIA (DE)\n\nJongsuk Thomas Nam – Director, Network of Asian Fantastic Films / BiFan (KR)\n\n**Moderator**: Sten-Kristian Saluveer, Head of NEXT, Marche Du Film, Festival De Cannes (FR/EST)\n\n#### Registration\nTo ensure the maximum quality of the viewing experience and to enable participants to ask questions from the speakers and make comments, we recommend to [pre-register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/interactive-panel-fight-or-fright-opportunities-for-the-genre-industry-tickets-104312345032) and attend the event in the official environment. \n\n#### Date and Time\n\nFriday, 8 May, Digital Panel via Zoom/Vimeo Livestream (platform tbc) – 5CET Tallinn, 4CET Barcelona, 3CET Dublin, 10AM Toronto.\n\nThe panel is also streamed live at Black Nights website [www.poff.ee](http://www.poff.ee/), [Tallinn Black Nights Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tallinnblacknightsff/) and [Haapsalu Horror & Fantasy Film Festival Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hoffestival/).",

    "contents_en": "This year’s [TV Beats Forum](https://industry.poff.ee/tv-beats-forum-2/), taking place fully online on November 26-27, takes a closer look at how COVID has impacted global production. **Guy Bisson**, Research Director of leading analytics firm Ampere Analysis, shares new research about how the pandemic has influenced film and TV shoots in Europe and beyond in 2020, and what the forecast is for 2021. In addition, producers from across Europe discuss new solutions in producing and co-producing in the COVID-era.  \n\n**Marge Liiske**, head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented: “**Series have become just as important as films in our programme now**. TV Beats Forum has always aimed to act as a meeting point of creatives in the region to provide opportunities to share their experiences, to find new partners and ideas and to attract more international productions to shoot here. For the first time at TV Beats, MIDPOINT TV Launch presents nine exciting new series from Central and Eastern Europe in addition to the five projects taking part in Script Pool TV,” she added.   \n\nAnother focus of TV Beats Forum in 2020 is gender equality. **Madeline Di Nonno**, CEO of Geena Davis Institute, will look into the latest trends in female representation in films and TV and see where the bright spots and challenges lay. To provide local insight, producers and broadcasters from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania look at the strides being made for women in the local film and TV industries and suggest the next steps.\n\nTV Beats Forum has always emphasised on sharing experiences and 2020 is no different. Among this year’s highlights is the case study of ***Stranger Things***, Netflix’s global hit that shot its fourth season in Lithuania. **Gary Tuck**, producer and managing director of Baltic Film Services, will share the challenges and the triumphs of the shoot. **Kateryna Vyshnevska** and **Olesya Lukyanenko** from Ukrainian production powerhouse Film.UA will shed some light to their global crime thriller *Hide and Seek*, forthcoming series *There Will Be People*, animated series Hrafn’s Academy, and new international co-productions. In addition, Estonian telecom Elisa presents their brand-new Estonian crime thriller *Line of Fire*.\n \nWith Industry @Tallinn & Baltic Event offering Russia in Focus in 2020, TV Beats Forum follows the lead. Russian speakers will include the team from Moscow-based 1-2-3 Production, director **Evgeny Nikishov** and producer **Valery Fedorovich**, creators of the new Russian dramatic thriller *Dead Mountain –The Dyatlov Pass Incident*, inspired by the mysterious disappearance of a group of hikers in 1959.  **Aleksey Kiselev** from Art Pictures and **Irina Sosnovaya**, Creative Producer of Yellow Black & White, both considered to be Russia’s booming independent studios, will talk about production in Russia and share the best practices in co-production. Also they will give an insight to fresh titles from their slates including *Sherlock: Russian Chronicles and Psycho*.\n \nIn addition to the focus on Russia, Germany also gets a closer look during TV Beats 2020. Germany’s hottest screenwriters including **Aron Lehmann** (The Last Word), **Thomas Stuber** (Hausen) and **Judit Banhazi** delve into their creative processes and talk about writing exciting shows that cut through the noise during the session “Germany – serious about series”. Also, a case study of *Deutschland 83* will welcome the show’s creator Jörg Winger. \n\nOther top international speakers include Film i Väst head of production **Peter Possne**, ScreenSkills UK Head of Film and Animation **Gareth Ellis-Unwin**, NT Group EVP and Chief Content Officer **Filippa Wallestam** and leading attorney **Christoph Fey**. \n\nThe conversations and panel discussions will be led by TV Beats co-curator and host Wendy Mitchell, international film reporter Tom Grater (Deadline) and programmer and journalist Tara Karajica (Fade to Her).

    "contents_en": "#### WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH YOUR ACCREDITATION? \n- Attend all the open industry events at industry.poff.ee  \n- Watch films on the festival’s online platform for professionals at proscreen.poff.ee \n- Book meetings using b.square at industrymeet.poff.ee\n\n \n#### HOW TO ATTEND VIRTUAL INDUSTRY EVENTS? \n\n- Industry open events are available for attending at industry.poff.ee with Eventival account used to apply for accreditation. [Here is a link to your account in Eventival](https://vp.eventival.com/poff/24th) \n- For checking the programme and attending the events, just sign in to [industry.poff.ee]( industry.poff.ee).  Login can be done is in the upper right corner - My Industry.\n- If you do not manage to attend the event live-stream, you can also do later as catchup.  \n- Please write to info.industry@poff.ee, when you need any help \n\n#### HOW TO NETWORK AND BOOK MEETINGS ONLINE \n- To arrange meetings, we’re using the networking platform b.square. You can also sign in here using the Eventival account used to apply for accreditation: industrymeet.poff.ee \n- If you have a project selected to Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, the project holder (in most cases the main producer) has a special networking account linked to the project, which includes some extra info to help you promote your project. \n- Please ensure that your personal and/or project details are up to date and to your liking in b.square. In particular, we would ask that you set your timezone correctly and mark your availability according to your own personal schedule (Co-Production Market project holders should keep their availability open for official market meetings on November 25-26). \n- To find out more about the projects participating at I@T&BE this year, you can browse the following project pdfs:\n- [Works in Progress Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_Works_in_Progress_Projects_2a1ceb8023.pdf)\n- [Script Pool Tallinn Film Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_Script_Pool_Film_Projects_c2cb9b2849.pdf)\n- [European Genre Film Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_European_Genre_Forum_Projects_79666bfb8a.pdf)\n- [Co-Production Market Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_Co_Production_Market_Projects_4e021df80b.pdf)\n- [Italy Goes Baltic Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_Italy_Goes_Baltic_Projects_19e650dcc3.pdf)\n- [POWR Baltic Stories Exchange Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_POWR_Baltic_Stories_Exchange_Projects_497010320b.pdf)\n- [Script Pool TV Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_Script_Pool_TV_Projects_fc8ca3b3f2.pdf)\n- [Midpoint TV Launch Projects](http://139.59.130.149/uploads/I_T_and_BE_Midpoint_TV_Launch_Projects_2b275074c3.pdf)\n\n- To find interesting projects and people otherwise, please head to the Participants tab and use the search and filtering button (above search) to narrow things down. \n- Don’t hesitate to reach out to info.industry@poff.ee, if and when you need any help \n\nYou can start requesting meetings with Co-Production Market projects and other market guests from now. For meeting Works in Progress, Script Pool Film or TV, EGF, POWR, Italy Goes Baltic and MIDPOINT TV Launch projects, you may like to wait until after the pitch before requesting meetings. We will send out an agenda of your booked meetings on the 22nd, but you can keep on booking depending on availability until the end of the market. You can also check your agenda anytime by logging into industrymeet.poff.ee.\n\n#### HOW TO WATCH FILMS?\n\n- All accredited professionals should have received an invitation to access proscreen.poff.ee. Please accept the invitation and create yourself a user on the page.  \n- Log in at [proscreen.poff.ee](proscreen.poff.ee) using Edge (PC) or Safari (Mac) browsers.   \n- Find the film you want to watch and enjoy!  \n\n#### NB!  \n- Please write to festivalassistant@poff.ee if you need any help.  \n- Please note that Industry ACCESS accreditation does not include the option to watch films at festival’s online platform.  \n- Due to security reasons recently found in Google's backend systems, currently, only the following browsers can be used to watch films on the festivals web platforms proscreen.poff.ee and kino.poff.ee: EDGE (PC) and Safari (Mac). This is to protect the interests of the film’s rights holders and filmmakers.  \n- Please note that the whole programme is not available on the site as the availability of the films depends on what particular films the filmmakers have decided to make available to professionals. The availability is different for press and industry accreditation holders.  \n- Films are available for watching only after the first public screening has taken place in the cinema.   \n- The films are available only for a restricted period and you will see the info once the date is approaching.   \n- You can choose subtitles in the playback window, but please note that not all of the films have that option.  \n \n\n\n#### HOW TO SURVIVE? \n- Don’t overdo it. Our resident digital guru, Sten, says one hour in Zoom is like three hours in real life. Prioritise the events that are most important. You can always watch things later on catch up. \n- Take some breaks and leave your screen. You could block off some time in your meetings calendar and get some fresh air. Don’t know how it is with you, but Tallinn weather is nice for a brisk walk. \n- Try things out beforehand. We’d encourage you to see how our networking platform works and maybe join one of our earlier open events to get the hang of everything with no last-minute panic! ",

The aim is to help young actors from the Baltic Sea region to promote themselves outside their home territory and acquire the practical skills needed for their future international careers.\n\nThe international jury selected six young actors from over 30 candidates, who are invited to attend the Black Nights Stars Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, a part of the 23rd edition of the **Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival** (PÖFF):\n\n**Magdalena Berus** (Poland)\n\n**Maria Dragus** (Germany)\n\n**Mimosa Willamo** (Finland)\n\n**Povilas Jatkevičius**  (Lithuania)\n\n**Risto Vaidla** (Estonia)\n\n**Franz Malmsten** (Estonia)\n\nThe young actors have been chosen to present their emerging talent from their first feature films and TV roles. Participating in Black Nights Stars will give these actors a chance to meet with film professionals and showcase their talent as well as get connected with international film professionals and gain some of the practical skills needed for their future international careers. During the program, they will participate in masterclasses, workshops and industry networking events.\n\nThis year’s international 2019 selection jury included Nikki Baughan (Screen International), Estonian Director of Photography Elen Lotman (*When You Least Expect; Demons*), former European Shooting Star and 2019 winner of the Bruno O’Ya Best Young Estonian Actor Award Rea Lest (Shooting Star 2019; *November*; *Scandinavian Silence*), UK and USA based casting director Jeremy Zimmerman (*Moon, Hellboy, Willow, Keeping Mum*) and Claudia Landsberger (creative producer).\n\n”I think last year’s Black Nights Stars programme was a great success with interesting events, panels and workshops, great people and great new contacts,” says Raakel Huikuri, Talent Agent from Lisa Richards Nordic. “We were introduced to brilliant new talent, and ended up signing a new client through the event.”\n\nThe Black Nights Stars program takes place from 25-27 November 2019. The Black Nights Stars programme is presented by the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event during the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and the European Regional Development Fund funded project Creative Gate.\n\n*Black Night Stars for 2019 (from the top left): Maria Dragus (Germany, photo by Natacha Lamblin), Risto Vaidla (Estonia), Franz Malmsten (Estonia), Povilas Jatkevičius (Lithuania), Magdalena Berus (Poland), and Mimosa Willamo (Finland).*\n\n",

    "contents_en": "“After opening our market to filmmakers from across the globe looking for a window to our region a few years ago, we are excited to admit that filmmakers from outside our traditional scope have finally found us,” Leana Jalukse, Co-Production Market Manager comments. “Our Focus Countries Ireland and Argentina are also bringing some winds of change, but, first and foremost, we’re proud to be showcasing some of the greatest talent from right next door – Central and Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia,” she adds.\n\nBaltic Event title countries, the Baltics, bring three debuts to the slate, each of which is following an award-winning short film of the director and is backed by an established production company – children’s film ***A Butterfly’s Heart*** by Inesa Kurklietyte, produced by Zivile Gallego of Fralita Films from Lithuania; ***Reconstruction*** by Evar Anvelt, with Laura Raud’s screenplay based on the novel by her father Rein Raud produced by Andreas Kask of Nafta Films, Estonia; and loosely autobiographical ***The Golden Spot*** by Liene Linde, produced by Guntis Trekteris of Ego Media, Latvia.\n\nContinuing on an autobiographical note, Polish coming-of-age story ***The Great Match*** by Filip Syczynski, backed by renowned producer Anna Rozalska of Match & Spark. Poland is also represented by a tough journey towards motherhood, ***The Seal Mother***, the second feature by Agnieszka Trzos, produced by award-winning Roman Jarosz of Holly Pictures.\n\nMoving on to Finland, Kaarle Aho (Black Ice, The Fencer) of Making Movies, whose numerous successful films have started out at Baltic Event over the years, brings to us ***The Good Driver***, the feature debut by award-winning documentary filmmaker Tonislav Hristov – the film will be a co-production with Bulgaria. Another co-production including Finland is ***Aria***, an intense love story by award-winning director Noud Heerkens, produced by Joram Willink of Bind, the Netherlands – with the third co-production party Belgium represented by the project’s screenwriter and DOP. Finland is also represented by the second feature by Miika Soini (*Thomas*), ***Never Enough White Roses***, a lyrical story dealing with the past, produced by Tiina Butter of Butterworks.\n\nTwo projects have been selected from Russia. ***Babydoll*** is the feature debut by award-winning short film director and actor Elena Lanskih, backed by the experienced Natalia Drozd of CTB Film Company. The second Russian entry, ***The Conference***, by award-winning director Ivan I. Tverdovskiy (*Zoology, Corrections Class*), is based on a tragic true story, the terrorist attack in Moscow 17 years ago; Katerina Mikhaylova of Vega Film produces.\n\nTrue events have also inspired the political thriller ***The File***, the second feature by Jonas Karasek, brought to us by prominent producer Wanda Adamik Hrycova (*The Line*) of Wandal Production, Slovakia.\n\nAlso represented by two debuts is Romania with ***Clara***, a portrait of the country’s recent exodus, by Sabin Dorohoi, produced by Daniel Burlac (*4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*) of Western Transylvania Studios; and ***Horia***, a coming-of-age story by Ana Maria Comanescu, backed by Ada Solomon (*Scrarred Hearts, Aferim!*), microFILM, who has won over 200 awards in her 20-something-year career.\n\nOur main slate is rounded up by two films treating the most complex of subjects –***The Exchange*** by debut director Sergo Ustyan tells the story of a prisoner exchange on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, Tigran Hambardzumyan of Persona Grata Group co-producing with Denmark, the UK, and Norway; and ***Sola***, following a man on a humanitarian mission, by award-winning Chadian film director Issa Serge Coelo (*Tartina City*) with the production helmed by Wilf Varvill, Fire Engine, UK, looking for co-producers from the Nordics.\n\nOn to the Irish focus, which features ***July Fly***, a story about redemption by debutant Stevie Russell, a successful commercial and music video director, brought to us by producer Samantha Corr of Venom Films; and ***The Sparrow*** by Michael Kinirons, whose features as a writer have boasted A-list casts and his shorts have won numerous awards, presented by Alicia Ní Ghráinne of Tiger Darling Productions.\n\nOff to the other side of the world, for our Spotlight on Argentina, which has only just joined Eurimages. ***The Thaw***, a detective story in a hostile environment, is the debut for director Facundo Escudero Salinas, who already boasts an impressive resume, produced by Nicolás Münzel Camaño of Pensilvania Films. The film is intended as a co-production with Bolivia and Uruguay, but is also looking for European co-producers.\n\n**A Eurimages Co-Production Development Award** worth 20 000 Euro will be handed out by a jury consisting of Uljana Kim, producer, Studio Uljana Kim, Lithuania, Simon Ofenloch, commissioning editor, ZDF ARTE, Germany, and Alex Traila, consultant, national representative of Eurimages, Romania.\n\nIn addition, one project will receive the **Screen International Best Pitch Award**, offering coverage of the lifecycle of the winning film, and two producers will receive the **Cannes Marché du Film Producers’ Network Award for Promising Young Producer** with free accreditations to next year’s edition.\n\n[Check out the list of Baltic Event Co-Production Market official selection](https://industry.poff.ee/co-production-market/)",

    "contents_en": "How European talents in cinema, games and digital content will stay relevant with global competition increasing, how European startup innovators are championing new business models, and how Europe can lead the way in industry diversity actions? Those will be the three main topics on the agenda of the upcoming European Film Forum (EFF), the European Commission’s dialogue with stakeholders on Wednesday, 27 November at the 23rd Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.\n\nTitled “Industry (R)evolution: Debating Tech, Distribution, and Future Talent for European Cinema,” the EFF will be a full-day executive-level public debate and showcase conference taking place at the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event business arm of the A-class festival. The EFF will focus on the global developments that impact the audiovisual industry, from Artificial Intelligence to digital platforms, and will present new initiatives from the creative, diversity, and tech fields for the upcoming 2020+ term of Europe’s innovative programmes.\n\n As in previous editions, 19 international film, gaming, content, startups, and diversity leaders will be sharing the stage, including Sander Saar (Strategy and Growth Consultant for Red Bull Media House, formerly the Walt Disney Company), André Bernhardt (Managing Founder at Indieadvisory & Target Games), Helene Granqvist (President of Women in Film & TV International), Lindsay Peters (Executive Director at Frontières), producer Isabelle Glachant (Chinese Shadows), and film editor Isabelle Teitler whose work credits include Darren Aronofsky’s mother!. Norwegian documentary director Tonje Hessen Schei along with impact advocate Danielle Turkov Wilson will present and discuss the highly anticipated documentary iHuman providing insights into Artificial Intelligence and the opportunities and threats of this groundbreaking technology for Europe and beyond.\n\nThe [European Film Forum (EFF)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-film-forum) was introduced by the European Commission in its 2014 Communication on European Film in the digital era. It is a platform for structured dialogue between policy makers and stakeholders in the audiovisual sector, travelling around European festivals and aiming to help develop a strategic policy agenda in the framework of the Digital Single Market. The EFF in Tallinn focuses on innovation between cinema, digital, and startup sectors and ties into Estonia’s position in digital leadership in the world. \n\nLucia Recalde, Head of MEDIA Unit, DG Connect, European Commission, said that the European audiovisual sector has a crucial role to play in our democracy and economy. “It is, however, undergoing a tremendous shift, being at the forefront of the digital, data and AI revolutions. The European Film Forum is, therefore, an event not to miss, as it is the place to debate how to scale up the European industry and how to further innovate and compete globally,” she added.\n\nSten-Kristian Saluveer, Curator of EFFT19 commented that they are delighted to continue our partnership with the European Commission and host the European Film Forum in Tallinn again. “The global challenges facing creators and storytellers in cinema and other content industries are growing everywhere, and especially in the framework of the upcoming 2020+ period of the MEDIA programme, events such as the Film Forum are indispensable to exchange best practices and to set bold innovation to motion for Europe’s content business,” he added.\n\nThe full programme of the European Film Forum 2019 is available at [europeafilmforumtallinn.com](europeafilmforumtallinn.com).",

    "contents_en": "In this year’s 8th instalment of Music Meets Film, primarily intended for composers and musicians aiming to create music for film, welcomes Peter Oxendale, forensic musicologist and copyright infringement specialist as one of the main speakers.\n\nIn discussion with Tom Player, Oxendale lays out a film composer’s dilemma with a relationship to a film’s temporary score, and how the attachment to it (Temp Love) leads to wide-spread plagiarism. We will hear music excerpts illustrating composers’ interpretations of original music, which venture into the realm of copyright infringement.\n\nPeter Oxendale is an internationally-renowned musicologist, forensic musicologist and expert witness in copyright matters. He has written over 3,000 reports for use in copyright infringement cases across the globe, being trained as a Single Joint Expert. He has prepared reports for most of the major record companies and music publishers across the world. Beyond the realm of forensic musicology, Oxendale has a background in classical music and is a songwriter as well as composing advertising jingles and library music. He is also active as a producer, musical director and arranger and is also a session musician, conductor and a programmer. [Read more](https://www.oxendale-music.co.uk/)\n\nMusic Meets Film 2019 will take place between November 25-27 across three locations – the Arvo Pärt Centre in Laulasmaa as well as the Music and Theater Academy and Forum Hotel in Tallinn. \n\n[More information on mentors and programme](https://industry.poff.ee/music-meets-film/)",

Automatically annotated photos turned to videos can be easily shared on social media or taken to other platforms for further video editing.\n\nIndustry@Tallinn & Baltic Event hosted a session looking into how FotoInMotion works, what kinds of solutions and experiences are available for you and your event, and how to utilize FotoInMotion AI-powered tools to take your creativity, production, or event to the next level.\n\n[Watch the session here](https://poff.elisastage.ee/landing/bc/mZ1D2CpUpk/8JkOpJTdEpu)\n\nSee more on FotoInMotion https://fotoinmotion.eu",

    "contents_en": "In this year’s 8th instalment of Music Meets Film, primarily intended for composers and musicians aiming to create music for film, welcomes Peter Oxendale, forensic musicologist and copyright infringement specialist as one of the main speakers.\n\nIn discussion with Tom Player, Oxendale lays out a film composer’s dilemma with a relationship to a film’s temporary score, and how the attachment to it (Temp Love) leads to wide-spread plagiarism. We will hear music excerpts illustrating composers’ interpretations of original music, which venture into the realm of copyright infringement.\n\nPeter Oxendale is an internationally-renowned musicologist, forensic musicologist and expert witness in copyright matters. He has written over 3,000 reports for use in copyright infringement cases across the globe, being trained as a Single Joint Expert. He has prepared reports for most of the major record companies and music publishers across the world. Beyond the realm of forensic musicology, Oxendale has a background in classical music and is a songwriter as well as composing advertising jingles and library music. He is also active as a producer, musical director and arranger and is also a session musician, conductor and a programmer. [Read more](https://www.oxendale-music.co.uk/)\n\nMusic Meets Film 2019 will take place between November 25-27 across three locations – the Arvo Pärt Centre in Laulasmaa as well as the Music and Theater Academy and Forum Hotel in Tallinn. \n\n[More information on mentors and programme](https://industry.poff.ee/music-meets-film/)",

Automatically annotated photos turned to videos can be easily shared on social media or taken to other platforms for further video editing.\n\nIndustry@Tallinn & Baltic Event hosted a session looking into how FotoInMotion works, what kinds of solutions and experiences are available for you and your event, and how to utilize FotoInMotion AI-powered tools to take your creativity, production, or event to the next level.\n\n[Watch the session here](https://poff.elisastage.ee/landing/bc/mZ1D2CpUpk/8JkOpJTdEpu)\n\nSee more on FotoInMotion https://fotoinmotion.eu",

    "contents_en": "According to Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, the record number of people interested in the event has pushed the team to put together an exhaustive programme with business, networking and learning elements. “2020 has forced also festivals and film markets to experiment and find new ways to operate. The models used until now are no longer effective, yet we still need to build fruitful business relationships, even if only online. In order to cope with changes, professionals need to have a good foresight about the future - what competencies and skills are needed, what kind of films to develop and produce, etc. Be informed, listen to the audiences, learn from your fellow professionals, analyse the course of history, and make it your own. And not only that - be kind, be attentive, connect with people - it is the key to the survival. We are giving only some of the tools that help you to move forward, as our colleagues from other film industry events have and will give theirs, so keep informed. ”  \n\nFirst and foremost, Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event continues to be a place to do business. The programme includes 76 projects are presented in eight different categories, including the works in progress, script competition, co-production market, and the ever-growing drama series part, with public pitchings and/or one-to-one meetings. Also, accredited guests have access to the networking platform that allows them to get together with other attendees virtually.  \n\nAs Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event has [Russia in Focus in 2020](https://industry.poff.ee/virtual-booth-en/panels-and-presentations/) (in collaboration with ROSKINO), participants will have the opportunity to find out more about projects, companies and the regional business environment. As the Black Nights Film Festival’s focus country is Germany, there will be opportunities to learn from some outstanding German film and series writers, in association with German Films. Also, 20 selected European Producers on the move will be attending the online-summit. \n\nLearning something new has also always been a cornerstone of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event and 2020 is no different. The intensive programme will kick off with [European Film Forum Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/about/european-film-forum-tallinn-2020/) zooming into leadership resilience, foresight and transformation of the film industry during COVID19. The half-day virtual conference will present 11 international film and media industry professionals sharing their experiences and insights on the most pressing topics for the European film, television and content industry.  \n\n[Music Meets Film](https://industry.poff.ee/about/music-meets-film/) takes place for the 9th time and brings together industry professionals sharing their insights on current trends in film scoring and how the film music industry operates, through discussions with four-time Oscar nominee Danny Elfman, Gavin Greenaway and Andrey A. Tarkovsky.  [The Black Nights Stars](https://industry.poff.ee/about/black-night-stars/) programme supports young actors from the Baltic Sea region, to make their next steps into the international arena and offers various open events throughout the week including a panel discussion with US casting directors about how to “make it” in the US, led by Lina Todd, and webinar about intimacy in front of the camera by Julia Effertz. \n\nThe extensive week will end with the two-day drama series programme [TV Beats](https://industry.poff.ee/about/tv-beats-forum/), taking place for the 3rd year in a row, that focuses on the challenges of production in the COVID era, as well as on gender equality in the industry. The programme includes several case studies providing know-how about international co-productions including the Netflix hit series Stanger Things; Ukrainian global crime thriller Hide and Seek and forthcoming series There Will Be People; and Russian thriller Dead Mountain –The Dyatlov Pass Incident, as well as brand new Estonian crime series In the Line of Fire. \n\nIn addition, there are workshops and masterclasses on how to approach international streamers, maximize the potential of a project through well-targeted packaging, develop new short formats like web series, write your new VR story, and much more. \n\n“We know it can be very tiring to be in front of a screen all day and that online fatigue drains our energy. Therefore, most of the panels and workshops will be also accessible to accredited guests for several weeks after the event as catchup, so everyone can find the time to hear the discussions and let them sink in, before starting the next “chapter”,” Liiske adds. \n\nIndustry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, one of the largest film events in Northern Europe, takes place from the 23rd to 27th of November 2020. Online by design, the virtual events, as well as the schedule, are accessible at industry.poff.ee.  ",

    "contents_en": "According to Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, the record number of people interested in the event has pushed the team to put together an exhaustive programme with business, networking and learning elements. “2020 has forced also festivals and film markets to experiment and find new ways to operate. The models used until now are no longer effective, yet we still need to build fruitful business relationships, even if only online. In order to cope with changes, professionals need to have a good foresight about the future - what competencies and skills are needed, what kind of films to develop and produce, etc. Be informed, listen to the audiences, learn from your fellow professionals, analyse the course of history, and make it your own. And not only that - be kind, be attentive, connect with people - it is the key to the survival. We are giving only some of the tools that help you to move forward, as our colleagues from other film industry events have and will give theirs, so keep informed. ”  \n\nFirst and foremost, Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event continues to be a place to do business. The programme includes 76 projects are presented in eight different categories, including the works in progress, script competition, co-production market, and the ever-growing drama series part, with public pitchings and/or one-to-one meetings. Also, accredited guests have access to the networking platform that allows them to get together with other attendees virtually.  \n\nAs Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event has [Russia in Focus in 2020](https://industry.poff.ee/virtual-booth-en/panels-and-presentations/) (in collaboration with ROSKINO), participants will have the opportunity to find out more about projects, companies and the regional business environment. As the Black Nights Film Festival’s focus country is Germany, there will be opportunities to learn from some outstanding German film and series writers, in association with German Films. Also, 20 selected European Producers on the move will be attending the online-summit. \n\nLearning something new has also always been a cornerstone of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event and 2020 is no different. The intensive programme will kick off with [European Film Forum Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/about/european-film-forum-tallinn-2020/) zooming into leadership resilience, foresight and transformation of the film industry during COVID19. The half-day virtual conference will present 11 international film and media industry professionals sharing their experiences and insights on the most pressing topics for the European film, television and content industry.  \n\n[Music Meets Film](https://industry.poff.ee/about/music-meets-film/) takes place for the 9th time and brings together industry professionals sharing their insights on current trends in film scoring and how the film music industry operates, through discussions with four-time Oscar nominee Danny Elfman, Gavin Greenaway and Andrey A. Tarkovsky.  [The Black Nights Stars](https://industry.poff.ee/about/black-night-stars/) programme supports young actors from the Baltic Sea region, to make their next steps into the international arena and offers various open events throughout the week including a panel discussion with US casting directors about how to “make it” in the US, led by Lina Todd, and webinar about intimacy in front of the camera by Julia Effertz. \n\nThe extensive week will end with the two-day drama series programme [TV Beats](https://industry.poff.ee/about/tv-beats-forum/), taking place for the 3rd year in a row, that focuses on the challenges of production in the COVID era, as well as on gender equality in the industry. The programme includes several case studies providing know-how about international co-productions including the Netflix hit series Stanger Things; Ukrainian global crime thriller Hide and Seek and forthcoming series There Will Be People; and Russian thriller Dead Mountain –The Dyatlov Pass Incident, as well as brand new Estonian crime series In the Line of Fire. \n\nIn addition, there are workshops and masterclasses on how to approach international streamers, maximize the potential of a project through well-targeted packaging, develop new short formats like web series, write your new VR story, and much more. \n\n“We know it can be very tiring to be in front of a screen all day and that online fatigue drains our energy. Therefore, most of the panels and workshops will be also accessible to accredited guests for several weeks after the event as catchup, so everyone can find the time to hear the discussions and let them sink in, before starting the next “chapter”,” Liiske adds. \n\nIndustry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, one of the largest film events in Northern Europe, takes place from the 23rd to 27th of November 2020. Online by design, the virtual events, as well as the schedule, are accessible at industry.poff.ee.  ",

After turning 20, I started working as creative producer in the event business, i.e. film festivals and events for the biggest companies around the world. Turning 30, I made a theatre play about it in the Gogol-centre, the theatre that famous director Kirill Serebrennikov made. During the pandemic and lockdown I turned my life around and started to realise my biggest childhood dream - working as a scriptwriter and director. And here I am today. \n",

During the 3-hour workshop “Writing for Virtual Reality\" participants, who are asked to pre-register, learn the challenges of writing for cinematic virtual reality and develop a 1-page script. \n",

Although immersive media traces back to the last century, there is little practical literature for writers interested in participating in this medium. In addition to their 1-page, participants will be requested to participate in several practical activities designed to sensibilize them to the challenges of virtual reality, including POV, cues, and technological limitations. \n\nAna Falcon will moderate the event, and it is created as part of her current research in Virtual Reality screenwriting methodologies. Falcon was selected for the 2008 Fusion Arts Exchange in Screenwriting and Film Production hosted by the University of Southern California and the US State Department. In 2017, she was distinguished with a Young Creators FONCA grant from the Mexican Culture Ministry. In 2019, she was a screenwriting finalist in the Watersprite International Student Film Festival hosted by the University of Cambridge. \n\nTo join the event, please register via email info.industry@poff.ee by Wednesday 25th of November.

    "lead_en": "The COVID19 outbreak has severely hit the audiovisual industry, with some estimates projecting losses up to EUR 24 billion in the next five years. Yet, despite the dramatic recession, a new-generation industry and business leadership is emerging to steer the cinema sector out of the crisis through actions of resilience, foresight and transformation of organisations, formats and business practices.

    "contents_en": "The European Film Forum (EFF) will return to the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival on 23 November for a half day of high-level debates and case studies focusing on how the industry can best overcome its challenges. The conference will address questions such as why and how to rebuild the broken value chain between creators, producers, sales and audiences. In addition, it will look at the new data driven playbook for European film and content marketing, and will showcase a new initiative to launch globally the Europe-built copyright infrastructure.  \n\nFurthermore, Adrian Wooton (CEO of Film London) will present the results of the largest industry consultation done by his organisation with the aim of resuming film productions in the city. The directors of the International Film Festival Rotterdam, the Udine Far East Film Festival, and the New Horizons Polish Days will explain how their events persisted during the crisis and will highlight the best strategies and actions to ensure the success of future festivals. Then, Robert Wolcott (a worldwide acclaimed innovation scientist and founder of Twin - formerly Kellogg Innovation network) will discuss in conversation with Sten Saluveer (EFFT curator) the basis of his work with political and Fortune 500 leaders across the globe, as well as the skills and actions required for the post-COVID era. Finally, the European Commission will present the novelties of the upcoming Creative Europe MEDIA programme, running from 2021 to 2027.  \n\n “The European Commission, via the new Creative Europe MEDIA programme and other supporting actions, will help the audiovisual ecosystem throughout the crisis and beyond to become more resilient and globally competitive. We will support the sector to recover (by compensating the losses and providing liquidity), to transform (by investing in a green, sustainable, digital and resilient industry) and to feel empower (by allowing more innovation and greater content access),” says Lucia Recalde, Head of Creative Europe MEDIA at the European Commission.   \n\n“The dramatic shifts in the global film industry have not come as a full shock as they have been here for a long time. That said, they were drastically accelerated by COVID19 which also added a long-term impact. Thus it is clear that this new reality will require not only financial but also new leadership skills and resources for the industry to revitalise. Thanks to our long-term collaboration with the European Commission, we have now the opportunity to bring this very timely and pressing topic to the forefront of this year's EFFT at the Black Nights Film Festival,” adds Sten-Kristian Saluveer, European Film Forum Tallinn Curator.  \n\nAs in previous editions, 11 international film and media industry leaders and policymakers will be sharing the (virtual) stage, including Lucia Recalde (Head of MEDIA Unit, European Commission), Ezra Eeman  (Senior Manager Digital, EBU), Tine Klint (CEO, Level K), Ewa Puszczyńska (Producer, Extreme Emotions), Todd Brown (Partner, XYZ Films), Birgit Karus (CEO, Noh Productions), Vanja Kaludjercic (Festival Director, IFFR), Sabrina Baracetti (Festival Director, Udine Far East FF), Weronika Czolnowska (New Horizons, Head of Industry), Adrian Wooton (Head, Film London), Philippe Rixhon (Infrastructure Designer, European Future Copyright Infrastructure) and Robert Wolcott (Co-Founder and Executive Director, Kellogg Innovation Network). \n \nThe European Film Forum in Tallinn will take place online and the live stream will be accessible to everyone at [industry.poff.ee]( industry.poff.ee). The full programme of the EFF is already available at [https://www.europeanfilmforumtallinn.online/](europeanfilmforumtallinn.online)  \n\nThe European Film Forum (EFF) was introduced by the European Commission in its 2014 Communication on European Film in the digital era, as a debate and discussion platform on the future evolution of European cinema and film industry. The EFF in Tallinn focuses on innovation between cinema, digital and the start-up sectors, and ties into Estonia’s position in digital leadership in the world.   ",

Although immersive media traces back to the last century, there is little practical literature for writers interested in participating in this medium. In addition to their 1-page, participants will be requested to participate in several practical activities designed to sensibilize them to the challenges of virtual reality, including POV, cues, and technological limitations. \n\nAna Falcon will moderate the event, and it is created as part of her current research in Virtual Reality screenwriting methodologies. Falcon was selected for the 2008 Fusion Arts Exchange in Screenwriting and Film Production hosted by the University of Southern California and the US State Department. In 2017, she was distinguished with a Young Creators FONCA grant from the Mexican Culture Ministry. In 2019, she was a screenwriting finalist in the Watersprite International Student Film Festival hosted by the University of Cambridge. \n\nTo join the event, please register via email info.industry@poff.ee by Wednesday 25th of November.

    "contents_en": "Cineuropa and AGICI have been working together for the past 3 years bringing delegations of Italian producers to foreign industry events with an eye to supporting international co-productions and forging solid connections with like-minded producers abroad. Producers taking part in the delegation are selected on the basis of individual projects aimed at co-productions with a specific territory or territories. We have worked with the Seville European Festival for two years with projects resulting in successful co-productions between Italy and Spain. This year we are working with Tallinn Black Nights Festival and focusing on projects aimed at co-productions between Italy and the Baltic or Scandinavian countries (as well as bordering territories). We are also working in co-operation with the Italian Ministry of Culture, which is launching for the third consecutive year, the co-development fund between Italy and the Baltic countries. The 5 projects selected for participation in the dedicated event “Italy goes Baltic” range from precise location needs in the Baltics to more open collaborations with international producers and also offer diverse genres and formats.\n\n#### Participating projects\n\n- ***[Hans](https://industry.poff.ee/project/hans/)*** -  author *Emanuela Ponzano*, producer *Marco Caberlotto*.

Under the RUSSIA IN FOCUS brand, the talented directors, actors, and producers, will present their projects in a number of the forum’s sections.",

    "contents_en": "\nRUSSIA IN FOCUS is a global presentation of Russian audiovisual content, film projects and creative talents at one of the key international co-production markets and producer's platforms, designed to build strong ties between Russian and international creative industry players. Supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and ROSKINO, the organization in charge of promoting Russian content worldwide, the Russian creative industries presents a variety of genres, styles, stories and a host of new names to the international professional audience. \n\n\"We are glad to start cooperation with one of the largest European film industry summits not only at the projects level but at the organizational level because the Baltic region is one of the key markets for Russian content; Estonia and Latvia are in the top 10 foreign markets, by box office, for Russian films abroad,\" says Evgenia Markova, ROSKINO CEO. \n\nShe adds that Russia has been represented at the Industry @ Tallinn & Baltic Event before, but this year they are participating in a large number of events: sections & panel discussions. Each of these events highlights Russia’s potential in different ways. \"For example, in the Co-Production Market we will show a range of projects that can be internationally successful thanks to their universality. Of particular importance, here we will also present the projects from the participants of the international educational program in coproduction, EAVE ON DEMAND IN RUSSIA, initiated by ROSKINO and supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation. This is a case in point of how educational projects have helped young Russian producers find their way on to the international markets. Another important thing of note is the participation of young Russian actors in the Black Nights Stars. It is especially important to increase the awareness of Russian talents to the wider audience abroad, and the first steps will be taken here at this event through meeting B2B partners, sales agents, etc. All in all, RUSSIA IN FOCUS is a great chance to explore the new emerging opportunities in Russia,\" Markova comments.\n\n#### Focus on Co-Production\n\nSpecial focus will be put on the Baltic Event Co-Production Market section, where five Russian projects will be presented to potential co-production partners. Two of them – *The Beilis Case* and *The Land Named Sasha* - will be introduced by the participants of the EAVE ON DEMAND IN RUSSIA program. Producers Marina Naumova (*The Beilis Case*) and Katerina Mikhailova (*The Land Named Sasha*) will use this opportunity to bring their projects to the international platform after they completed their EAVE practice with international experts.\n\nCo-production is the new focus of the Russian content industry - it facilitates the promotion on the world’s markets, accumulates international experience and contributes to the creative industry sector of all countries involved in the co-production process. The great potential of the Russian film industry in the field of co-production was been proven with the many successful projects in recent years. These include *Conference* by Ivan Tverdovsky (Russia, Estonia, Great Britain, Italy), which was included in the short list of the Giornate degli Autori section of the 77th Venice Film Festival;  *The Whale Boy* by Philip Yuriev (Russia, Poland, Belgium) which received the Director’s Award in the Giornate degli Autori section of the 77th Venice Film Festival; *Persian Lessons* by Vadim Perelman (Russia, Germany, Belarus), presented at the 70th anniversary Berlin Film Festival and many others.\n\nDespite the unprecedented circumstances and multiple closed borders, quite a number of co-pro projects are still in progress right now. Among the current co-production partners of Russia are Canada, Germany, France, Switzerland, Great Britain, Mexico and Ireland. Also, earlier in October 2020, Eurimages (European cultural support fund of the Council of Europe), announced it would give subsidies to several Russian co-production projects with Slovenia, Turkey, Germany, and France. One such project is *Captain Volkonogov Escaped* by Natalya Merkulova and Alexey Chupov in co-production with Estonia and France.\n\nOne of the most important events of the forum under the RUSSIA IN FOCUS brand, will be a number of special panels and discussions devoted to co-production opportunities.  In particular, the rebate system and subsidy models will form the core of the round table discussion **Filming opportunities and financial initiatives in Russian NorthWest**. Today, the Northwestern regions of Russia such as Kaliningrad, Karelia, Murmansk, and Novgorod regions, offer not only amazing shooting locations with beautiful landscapes close to European borders but also financial support to foreign film producers.\n\nAnother important point of focus will be put on co-production opportunities with Scandinavian producers during the round table \n**Adaptation vs. Co-production:  Russian - Scandinavian case. Producers and showrunners of Russian TV series** – adaptations of internationally acclaimed Scandi Noir series, and Russian TV series acclaimed abroad, will discuss the most efficient possibilities for cross-country collaborations.\n\nRussian talents and projects will also be presented in the TV Beats Forum, Works in Progress section, POWR Baltic Stories Exchange and the Black Nights Stars programs. \n\nA full description of the RUSSIA IN FOCUS program can be found [here](https://industry.poff.ee/virtual-booth-en/panels-and-presentations/) \n",

The festival’s professionals’ film-watching platform had 9779 viewings. \n\nA major shift took place with the virtual event attendances as Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event had close to 900 virtual accreditations from 60 countries – both numbers have set a record for the summit. The programme of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event 2020, online by design, included 62 events and several of them were available online without accreditation as well, including its most popular event – the European Film Forum Tallinn.  \n\nIndustry@Tallinn & Baltic Event director Marge Liiske commented: “Having organised a record attendance numbers' virtual industry event over five consecutive days in three parallel broadcasting channels, project presentations and meetings, showed us the potential of online in the future. We also feel grateful for the industry professionals having such a strong sense of community and a powerful will of collaboration. I hope to meet and thank you all in person in 2021!” \n\n“We welcomed a record number of 76 projects at this year’s edition. As online pitching and networking is something the whole industry is just getting used to, we and the juries were positively surprised how professionally the projects were presented and how eagerly industry professionals took part of the online meeting possibilities,” Liiske added.  \n\nOrganising online industry events is much like learning by doing and could only be possible thanks to the smooth collaboration between the team, mentors and experts, participants, as well as to the generosity of supporters and partners. “We are very grateful for our sponsors Elisa, Roskino and Tallinn City - and supporters including German Films, Estonian, Finnish and Lithuanian Film Institutes, Cultural Endowment of Estonia, who’s co-operation and effort has allowed us to create our online summit discussing the most urgent topics in the film industry. It would have been so much more challenges, if not impossible, without them,” she commented. Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event is co-funded by the Creative Europe Media Programme of the European Union. The European Film Forum Tallinn is organised by the European Commission’s mandate \n\nFacts about Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event: \n\n- 62 online events \n- 76 projects presented \n- Over 700 virtual one-to-one meetings \n- 35 000 virtual attendances \n- 895 online accreditations \n- Guests from 60 countries ",

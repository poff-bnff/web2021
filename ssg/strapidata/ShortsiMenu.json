For that purpose DCPs must meet the following requirements: provided screening DCPs must be unencrypted, or with DKDM for festival lab, as original language versions (OV) with separate accompanying subtitles as version-file packages (VF). DCPs with burned in subtitles are not accepted in this case.\n\nIf the transfer of translated subtitles onto the DCP is not agreed with the representative of the film, the translations will be shown electronically.\n\nAll screening copies for all sections, if provided with any subtitles, must have the subtitles on the active picture area and not in the letterbox area.

These include wrongly placed or missing subtitles, or wrong soundtracks.\n\nUnencrypted DCPs are strongly preferred. In case of encrypted DCPs, the festival requires one test KDM per film free of charge for quality assurance and technical testing for our test-screen or DKDM for laboratory testing. The quality assurance purpose KDM or DKDM is requested to be valid from the date the DCP arrives at the festival till 2 days after the festival.\n\nThe producer or film representative is requested to provide appropriate screening KDMs valid from 3 days before the start of the festival and 2 days after the festival, but in minimum at least 72 hours prior to screenings, and 48 hours after the screening.

Quality assurance purpose DKDM does not exempt from providing screening KDMs if not agreed upon otherwise.\n\nThe festival supports 2K and 4K content. However, not all screens have a 4K projecting capability. The festival therefore cannot guarantee that all 4K films will be screened in a 4K resolution.\n\nWe can accept high-frame-rate DCPs (HFR), however we are only able to screen them in selected cinema halls.

PÖFF tuleb koroonaviiruse tõttu teistsugune kui varasemad – esimest korda saab filme vaadata nii kinodes kui ka veebis. Teeme koostööd meditsiiniettevõtetega SYNLAB ja Medicum ning perearstikeskusega Sinu Arst, samuti konsulteerime Terviseametiga, et tagada kinokülastajatele turvaline keskkond ning vältida koroonaviiruse levikut festivaliga seotud üritustel.\n\nHoolime oma külastajatest väga ja soovime, et festivalielamus oleks kõigile võimalikult meeldiv, mugav ja turvaline. PÖFF kestab kaks ja pool nädalat ning selleks, et jõuaksime koos teiega eduka lõpuni, oleme koostanud allolevad juhised ja reeglid:\n\n- Tungivalt soovitame osta piletid PÖFFi või Piletilevi kodulehelt. Kodust pileti ostmine on lihtne, mugav ja turvaline.\n- Kogu festivaliinfo on leitav PÖFFi kodulehelt. Kui jääd hätta, siis kirjuta info@poff.ee. Aitame Sind hea meelega.\n- PÖFFi infopunkti palume festivali ajal külastada äärmisel vajadusel. Meie kõigi huvides on see, et piletikassadesse ei tekiks järjekordi. Järgime 2+2 reeglit. \n- Festivali üritustel ja -alal on maskide kandmine rangelt soovituslik. Seansile võib tulla oma maskiga. Kui Sul maski ei ole, saad selle festivalialale sisenedes meie vabatahtlikult tasuta. \n- Kui Sa ostad pileti siiski PÖFFi kassast, ole valmis selleks, et pilet isikustatakse. Selleks küsitakse Sinu andmeid. Oma istekohti saalis muuta ei tohi. \n- Enne saali sisenemist võidakse valikuliselt mõõta külastajate kehatemperatuuri. Juhul, kui tunned ennast halvasti, palume Sul koju jääda ja vaadata meie filme veebis.\n- Festivalikinodes on desinfitseerimisvahendid, mida palume kõigil kasutada.\n- Seansside vaheajal puhastame ja desinfitseerime kõiki kinosaale.\n- Pärast seansi lõppu palume külastajaid saalist lahkuda ridade kaupa, et uste juurde ei tekiks troppe.\n\n\nMis saab Sinu piletist, kui seanss või festival peaks COVID-19 viiruse tõttu ära jääma?\n- Loodame, et oled nõus vahetama ärajäänud seansi pileti sama filmi järgmise seansi pileti vastu. Kui soovitud filmi enam kinos ei ole, pakume võimalust vahetada pilet mõne muu filmi pileti vastu või vaadata sama filmi veebi vahendusel, kus näeb enamikku festivali filmidest.\n- Soovijatel on võimalik ka ärajäänud seansi pileti eest makstud raha PÖFFi toetuseks annetada. Piletitulu on meile üks olulisemaid sissetulekuallikaid – eriti tänavu, kui koroonaviirus on teinud filmitööstuse ja kultuuriürituste elu väga keeruliseks. Annetamise puhul palume teavitada festivali aadressil kassa@poff.ee. \n- Kui ükski nendest lahendustest ei sobi, ostame Sinu pileti tagasi. \n\n\nAnname üheskoos endast parima, et 24. PÖFF oleks sama äge ja turvaline elamus, nagu on olnud varasematel aastatel!",

The explosive shock, unprecedented in its breadth and impact, has not only imploded the full value chain of cinema but has brought to the forefront the most significant challenges the medium and the industry has faced since its birth – whichever angle one takes.\n\nThe European independent sector has witnessed perhaps the hardest, with all but a few significant festivals canceled, productions suspended, and distribution chains are broken with cinemas and audiences coping with on the national lockdown fronts.\n\nFrom a global perspective, perhaps 2020 has been the best year ever for watching, with accounts showing a tremendous spike in the consumption of audiovisual content and a staggering 79% increase in streaming hours, leading some of the super players to gap the quality of their services.\n\nAs paradoxical it might seem, the global COVID epidemic has not derailed the film industry by surprise as many would love to believe, but savagely accelerated the already current transformation processes. For a fact, few players emerging with the bounty while many are jogging dazedly behind.\n\nThus, the new playbook for a new normal is here – the question is how to define opportunities, strategies, and best practices and transform fast with foresight and resilience before it’s too late.\n\nThe European Film Forum, as a debate and discussion platform on the future evolution of European cinema and film industry, will return to Tallinn on November 23, 2020, with a half a day virtual and hybrid summit of executive-level debates, case studies, and showcases on the most pressing topics for the European film, television, and content industry at the time of COVID.\n\n**The focus themes of the 2020 edition are:**\n\n- The new industry leadership playbook at the time of COVID19 Pandemic – how to transform successfully through resilience and foresight\n- Redefining windows and rights: a time for European film distribution and exhibition value chain 2.0\n- Reaching the audience during a lockdown: A deep dive into the best practices of VOD, Livestreaming, Watch Parties and Alternative Distribution\n- Reimagining Film Festivals during lockdown: How have festivals adapted, failed, or succeeded and how to define the future role of the festivals at the European level and beyond\n- European Frontieres: The public-private model and European Copyright Infrastructure as an example of future European catalyst\n\nJoin the half-day hybrid and virtual summit and debate, learn, and network with 100+ European and global industry executives, entrepreneurs, and policymakers shaping European cinema’s future.\n\nThe European Film Forum is organized by the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and Industry Tallinn by the European Commission's mandate. The summit is curated by Sten-Kristian Saluveer, Head of NEXT @Marche Du Film - Festival de Cannes, and Strategist @ Accelerate Estonia - the moonshot lab powered by The Republic of Estonia to develop solutions for wicked global problems.\n\n[Check out the booklet of EUROPEAN FILM FORUM TALLINN 2020](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pFczbDVyA9cWSTN3r7C-nLYtXEC-3LY8&export=download)\n\n**Timetable & Sessions (in EET)**\n\n16.00 – 16.10: Opening Words: The European Industry vs. COVID19: Resilience, Alternatives, Opportunities. \n*Sten-Kristian Saluveer - EFFT Curator, Head of NEXT, MDF - Festival de Cannes*\n\n16.10 – 16.20 Opening Keynote by the European Commission  *Martin Dawson, European Commission*\n\n16.20- 16.35 European Cinema and Content Industry vs. the World during the Pandemic.\n *Ezra Eeman - Senior Manager Digital, Transformation, and Platforms, European Broadcasting Union (EBU)*\n\n16.35 – 17.10 Is digital the new theatrical?

The explosive shock, unprecedented in its breadth and impact, has not only imploded the full value chain of cinema but has brought to the forefront the most significant challenges the medium and the industry has faced since its birth – whichever angle one takes.\n\nThe European independent sector has witnessed perhaps the hardest, with all but a few significant festivals canceled, productions suspended, and distribution chains are broken with cinemas and audiences coping with on the national lockdown fronts.\n\nFrom a global perspective, perhaps 2020 has been the best year ever for watching, with accounts showing a tremendous spike in the consumption of audiovisual content and a staggering 79% increase in streaming hours, leading some of the super players to gap the quality of their services.\n\nAs paradoxical it might seem, the global COVID epidemic has not derailed the film industry by surprise as many would love to believe, but savagely accelerated the already current transformation processes. For a fact, few players emerging with the bounty while many are jogging dazedly behind.\n\nThus, the new playbook for a new normal is here – the question is how to define opportunities, strategies, and best practices and transform fast with foresight and resilience before it’s too late.\n\nThe European Film Forum, as a debate and discussion platform on the future evolution of European cinema and film industry, will return to Tallinn on November 23, 2020, with a half a day virtual and hybrid summit of executive-level debates, case studies, and showcases on the most pressing topics for the European film, television, and content industry at the time of COVID.\n\n**The focus themes of the 2020 edition are:**\n\n- The new industry leadership playbook at the time of COVID19 Pandemic – how to transform successfully through resilience and foresight\n- Redefining windows and rights: a time for European film distribution and exhibition value chain 2.0\n- Reaching the audience during a lockdown: A deep dive into the best practices of VOD, Livestreaming, Watch Parties and Alternative Distribution\n- Reimagining Film Festivals during lockdown: How have festivals adapted, failed, or succeeded and how to define the future role of the festivals at the European level and beyond\n- European Frontieres: The public-private model and European Copyright Infrastructure as an example of future European catalyst\n\nJoin the half-day hybrid and virtual summit and debate, learn, and network with 100+ European and global industry executives, entrepreneurs, and policymakers shaping European cinema’s future.\n\nThe European Film Forum is organized by the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and Industry Tallinn by the European Commission's mandate. The summit is curated by Sten-Kristian Saluveer, Head of NEXT @Marche Du Film - Festival de Cannes, and Strategist @ Accelerate Estonia - the moonshot lab powered by The Republic of Estonia to develop solutions for wicked global problems.\n\n[Check out the booklet of EUROPEAN FILM FORUM TALLINN 2020](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pFczbDVyA9cWSTN3r7C-nLYtXEC-3LY8&export=download)\n\n**Timetable & Sessions (in EET)**\n\n16.00 – 16.10: Opening Words: The European Industry vs. COVID19: Resilience, Alternatives, Opportunities. \n*Sten-Kristian Saluveer - EFFT Curator, Head of NEXT, MDF - Festival de Cannes*\n\n16.10 – 16.20 Opening Keynote by the European Commission  *Martin Dawson, European Commission*\n\n16.20- 16.35 European Cinema and Content Industry vs. the World during the Pandemic.\n *Ezra Eeman - Senior Manager Digital, Transformation, and Platforms, European Broadcasting Union (EBU)*\n\n16.35 – 17.10 Is digital the new theatrical?

# Task 001: Actor Profile Type Assignment Bug

## Problem Description
- **Reporter**: User (Jaan)
- **Issue**: Loviise Kapper does not appear in Creative Gate actors filter despite having "Actor" role
- **Current behavior**: Profile appears in services instead of actors
- **Expected behavior**: Profile should appear when filtering by "Actor" role in actors view

## Investigation Plan
- [x] Check if profile data exists in YAML files
- [x] Verify role data in search_persons.is_in_creative.en.yaml
- [x] Check filter data in filters_persons.is_in_creative.en.yaml
- [x] Verify frontend receives correct data
- [x] Investigate profile type assignment logic
- [x] Check isActor() function implementation

## Root Cause Analysis
**Found**: The `isActor()` function in `fetch_profile_data_from_yaml.js` was incorrectly using `Object.entries()` to iterate over `role_at_films` array, which prevented proper role ID checking against `ACTOR_ROLES` list.

## Proposed Solution
Fix the `isActor()` function to properly iterate over arrays:
- Replace `Object.entries(person.role_at_films)` with direct array iteration
- Add proper array type checking
- Add debugging for troubleshooting

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Modify isActor() function in fetch_profile_data_from_yaml.js
- [x] Add array type checking
- [x] Add debugging console.log
- [ ] Test with build process
- [ ] Remove debugging after confirmation

## Testing Plan
- Rebuild profile data
- Check that Loviise Kapper appears in actors view
- Verify other actors still work correctly
- Check console logs for debugging output

## Status
- [x] Investigation
- [x] Solution design
- [x] Implementation
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Complete

## Notes
**Retrospective**: This task was implemented immediately without proper planning. In future, should create task file first and get approval before making code changes.

        I was born in 1999 in the south of Germany, Freiburg, as the son of an
        australian painter and an art managing mother. Through a rough but
        lovely childhood, I got interest in acting. After being part of Stage
        Entertainment Musical "Tarzan" for one year, I entered my first acting
        agency and started to shoot first small movies. At the same time I went
        to a Waldorf School, which allowed me to get more deeply into acting. As
        I got older, I was allowed to shoot more bigger movies and
        tv-productions that helped me to get finally engaged into acting as a
        professional career.  I went to an acting school ("New Talent
        Schauspielschule") for two years, changed the agency, and continued my
        way. I just made the decision, and succeeded to be applied for 2021 to
        the highly profiled acting school, Hochschule für Musik und Theater
        Leipzig, to graduate as Master of Arts in four years. Besides acting, I
        can restore my energy and balance in traveling by myself, experiencing
        culture and sports. My favourite destination is a farm in Algarve,
        Potugal, where my godson lives. At least once a year I get engaged in
        the daily working life of farming, supporting the family and being part
        of an international community.

        Marike Muselaers started her career at Fortissimo Films and RTL
        Netherlands before joining the Lumière team. After more than 10 years in
        sales, acquisitions and co-productions, Marike has been appointed co-CEO
        of the Lumière Group, in her words “a full ecosystem in which
        production, financing, distribution, a digital platform, 2 cinemas and
        an animation studio are all working closely together to bring the best
        stories to the Benelux audience and the rest of the world”.

        TV series recently co-produced are seasons of THE TEAM, OCCUPIED, STHLM
        REQUIEM, STATE OF HAPPINESS and BULLETS. Currently in development
        (amongst other projects) are Belgian repatriation drama/comedy SOIL and
        MIDPOINT graduate TRANSIT.

        Next to co-leading the Lumière Group and finding new compelling stories
        and characters, Marike is always looking for the sweet spot between
        creative and commercial. She is determined to create new innovative
        business models and partnerships in this fast-paced, challenging, but
        never boring industry.

        My name is Henessi, I live and work in Estonia as a freelancer,
        performing both in theatre and film. I studied theatre and acting in the
        University of Tartu Viljandi Culture Academy and graduated in 2019. ​

        Besides acting I have also studied yoga and herbal medicine and could
        also be found behind the DJ decks. ​ As an artist, I am into growth and
        progress. I would like to collaborate in projects that can open new
        perspectives and expand my experience and methods as an actress. It is
        important to me that the work I do has something to say and improve in
        our society and environment. I believe that a work of art can and should
        touch the audience, widen their perception, and make a difference in
        their heart and in their mind.

        Before my studies as an actress, I was devoted to dancing for four
        years, which has made me fond of the idea of working on projects that
        are also connected with dance, choreography or martial arts. ​

        I think I am quite adventurous, love experimenting, facing challenges
        and making mistakes. I do my work with love and so it never feels like
        work to me.

                synopsis_en: >-
                    Its the last week of school in a small polish town's junior
                    high school. Waiting for the final party, several students
                    pass the time at a city pool, as if anticipating the
                    emotional whirlwind they are about to experience. The action
                    takes place somewhere in Poland, where ‘LGBT free zones’ are
                    a reality in 2020. It’s a story about young people, their
                    problems and romantic endeavours in the era of the Internet
                    and social apps, when creating genuine relationships is
                    unnaturally difficult.

                    Maria, a loving mother and grandmother, a free-spirited
                    Polish Nobel Prize winner, living  in Tuscany, fosters a

                    runs a nearby seaside inn. After a terrorist attack in Rome,
                    Maria refuses to succumb to the hysterical fear and
                    anti-immigrant sentiment that quickly emerge, deciding in
                    her acceptance speech of a local honor to boldly decry
                    Europe’s eroding democracy-but she is unprepared for the
                    public and personal havoc her comments wreak.

        Rein Zobel is a director and producer born in 1984. After attaining a
        Master’s Degree

        in Psychology, he went to Denmark to attend a 4-month film course. This
        led to him

        working as an editor, animator and director in different production
        companies for 7

        years. In 2015, Rein graduated Baltic Film and Media School in Film Arts
        as a Film

        Director. While working mainly in advertising, Rein also became
        interested in virtual

        reality and co-founded his VR content creation company Maru VR
        Production in

        2016. In one year, it became the most productive VR content company in
        Estonia

        (and probably in the Baltics). While creating VR content, Rein’s
        ultimate purpose has

        always been to explore the storytelling potential of VR and how it
        differentiates from

        film. Rein organized a VR workshop “Demystifying VR” for Tallinn Black
        Nights Film

        Festival.

                    The Estonian team Kalev faces a momentous decision. With
                    Estonian independence seemingly within reach, a rising tide
                    of public opinion opposes the Estonian national team’s
                    participation in the USSR’s championship. That would
                    contradict the people’s aspirations for liberation. As

                    Erik is convinced he has a stone for a heart. When his
                    family moves to a house they inherited, he is confronted by
                    Maria whom Erik's parents want to kick out along with her
                    father. Maria refuses to move and promises to make Erik's
                    life a living hell.

                    As a last attempt to defeat Erik, Maria goes to look for her
                    mother who disappeared two years ago. Together they end up
                    on a fantastical journey to the In-Between-World and Erik
                    learns how hard it really is to wear a heart of stone.

        After 25 years as Creative Director in the advertising business in
        Mexico, I decided to quit advertising and start a new career as a film
        maker. "50 (or two whales meet at the beach)" is my first feature film.
        Last September the film had its first official screening at the 35.
        Venice International Film Critic's Week. Hopefully, "50" will be
        released commercially next year (exact date to be determined by our
        turbulent times) in Mexico, and I will start shooting my second feature
        by the end of 2021.

                    Today’s schoolchildren are “digital natives”, but the
                    technological revolution has disrupted the teaching
                    profession too, and while digital technology invades our
                    lives, schools are struggling to keep up. Teachers are
                    concerned: today’s schools are ill-adapted to the challenges
                    of the 21st Century and failure levels are worryingly high.
                    Increasingly, kids are bored at school. A documentary is
                    directed by Martin Meissonnier, produced by CAMPAGNE
                    PREMIERE (France) and Vesilind (Estonia).

        After studying drama at Bristol University, Ben’s first industry job was
        as a runner at ITV Studios Drama. Subsequently, Ben became Assistant to
        the Creative Director and he’d only recently made the leap to Junior
        Script Editor when a show he was assisting on was greenlit by ITV/PBS.

        This show was Mr Selfridge (10x60). Ben became part of the original
        creative team that set up the series and its writers' room alongside
        creator Andrew Davies. He went on to oversee the script process on all
        four seasons as Script Editor/Executive, eventually writing his own
        episode in the final season.

        Soon after, Ben worked with show-runner Kate Brooke to set up
        contemporary crime thriller Bancroft (4x60 for ITV) which ran for two
        seasons. Ben was Script Executive/Story Consultant and co-wrote three
        episodes with Kate across both seasons.

        As Development Executive, Ben recently oversaw the development and story
        of Sarah Williams' family mystery drama Flesh and Blood, starring Imelda
        Staunton, which premiered this February on ITV1. Most recently, he wrote
        an episode of Kate O'Riordan's new Channel 5 psychological drama
        Penance, which became one of the highest-rated dramas ever on the
        channel in March 2020.

        In 1999, Gabor heard the siren call of TV drama and ended up on the
        writing staff of a daily soap at Grundy UFA. Having emerged to the level
        of story editor, he burnt out quickly and left after 4 years of hard
        labour. Based on his experiences, he wrote a book on TV writing and was
        subsequently invited to teach scriptwriting and dramaturgy at various
        institutions, among them the University of Theatre and Film Arts in
        Budapest. In 2006, he co-founded a script consulting firm and spent the
        following years as a hired gun, doing script editing and writing.

        Gabor was offered the job of script development executive at the
        fledgling Local Original Production department at the Budapest office of
        HBO Europe in 2010. He later became the Creative Executive, responsible
        for all creative aspects of development and production on all Hungarian
        HBO shows as a producer, the latest being the third season of Golden
        Life, a crime thriller/family drama. In this role, he had also assisted
        in the launch of original production for HBO Europe in the Adria region.

        After leaving HBO at the end of 2018, Gabor went on to found his own
        company, Joyrider, specializing in creating and developing high-end
        scripted serial content for the international market.

        In 2017, Sullivan Le Postec created his first series, Les Engagés (known
        as Woke internationally). Two critically acclaimed seasons (10x10mn) of
        the digital drama have aired on the French public broadcaster's web
        fiction platform. In 2021 the series will be back with Les Engagés:
        XAOC, a brand-new adventure that will take the characters in unexpected
        directions for 3x45mn episodes. For the first time, Sullivan will be
        directing too.


        Sullivan started out as a TV critic and journalist. For more than ten
        years, he wrote for different publications, printed or online. He then
        began the transition to become a TV writer himself, penning episodes for
        Dernier Recours (2013) and the second season of TF1's Falco (2013). In
        2014, after a year in Berlin, he graduated from Serial Eyes, Europe's
        premier postgraduate training programme for television writers and
        producers.

        Valgeir Sigurðsson is an Icelandic composer and producer. His music
        blends contemporary classical writing and esoteric electronic
        production, sometimes to a point where one is indistinguishable from the
        other.

        Valgeir worked closely with fellow Icelander Björk, a collaboration
        which began with her Oscar-nominated score for Lars Von Trier’s Dancer
        In The Dark. He founded the Bedroom Community label in 2006 with Nico
        Muhly and Ben Frost, where he cemented his sonic signature with his own
        solo work on the label, in addition to albums with Muhly, Frost, Sam
        Amidon and Daníel Bjarnason, and an extensive collaboration with viola
        da gamba player, Liam Byrne. 

        Valgeir has composed orchestral and chamber music for the likes of the
        City of London Sinfonia, Winnipeg Symphony, Crash Ensemble, Alarm Will
        Sound, Nordic Affect and the British violinist, Daniel Pioro. His scores
        frequently incorporate the use of electronics and have also been
        performed by the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra, BBC Symphony Orchestra,
        BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Spokane Symphony, Indianapolis Symphony
        and many others. He has written music for stage, dance and screen. His
        film scores include An Acceptable Loss and the Icelandic feature The
        County, and his score for the environmental documentary Dreamland
        (Draumalandið) was nominated for best score at EDDA, the Icelandic Film
        Academy Awards.

        If someone were to be replaced in place of Werther, Antoni would be
        among the nominees.

        His naive look at reality can attract the audience. He proved that as he
        played parts in Dywizjon 303 “Historia Prawdziwa” by Denis Delić, and
        “Legiony” by Dariusz Gajewski.

        Raised at the farm ploughing the field, he has been developing his
        skills (including acting) for years while doing his best at every
        production he took part in. Speaking of which, Antoni fluently speaks
        English and French. His language skills had an overtone in productions
        such as BREAKING THE BAND season II: GUNS’N’ROSES by Zoran Trajkovic; 7
        GODZIN W POCIĄGU by Miguel Velez.

        One of his adventures inspired him to learn Russian, and he managed to
        train figure ice skating at age 23 (with a little help of ballet). 

        Worth mentioning is also his part in epic series “Korona Królów” where
        his creation of Skirgaila – Polish king’s brother met with the best
        reception. As important as attracting the audience, Antoni also did his
        best in preparation with history interview, medieval swordfight, and
        horse riding. 

        In his acting journey, he also met with Oscar-nominated direction
        Bartosz Konopka in Netflix Original series “The Woods”.

        Reimo Sagor is considered as one of the most promising young talents of
        Estonia.

        After graduating from the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre in 2014,
        Reimo has worked consistently in numerous film, TV and on stage
        productions, gathering multiple awards and nominations.

        It was his astonishing performance as the young struggling single father
        in Liina Trishkina- Vanhatalo’s ”TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT”,  that brought
        Reimo to the attention of mainstream audiences in Estonia as well as to
        a wider global audience. The film was Estonia's foreign-language Oscar
        submission on its release year in 2018.

        Reimo's recent works include Martti Helde’s feature “SCANDINAVIAN
        SILENCE” that made its European premiere at the Karlovy Vary
        International Film Festival, where it won the Europa Labels Prize. He
        was also recently seen in the international spy thriller “HAMILTON”,
        starring alongside Jakob Oftebro and Katia Winter. 

        Currently Reimo is working on Ove Musting’s feature ”KALEV” and the
        tv-series ”WITH ONE EYE OPEN,” a Swedish contemporary action thriller
        set in 1996.

                    Located in the heart of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, the
                    Hippodrome used to be the centre of entertainment. This
                    hypnotic black and white film is an ode to a disappearing
                    era and a unique subculture in a place soon to be demolished
                    to make way for yet another brand new office building
                    complex in the city’s never-ending triumphal march of
                    business-oriented real estate development.

                titleOriginal: CAT IN TNE WALL
                synopsis_en: >-
                    Southeast London council estate, riven by social and
                    economic divisions. Irina, a Bulgarian woman lives there
                    with her small son and her brother. The lift serves as a
                    toilet, the multi-cultural residents exchange shouts rather
                    than pleasantries, and an expensive refurbishment is
                    undesired but must be paid for. And in the midst of this: an
                    apparently owner-less cat, that has had enough of the heated
                    atmosphere, barricades itself ‘in the wall’.

                titleOriginal: WOMEN DO CRY
                synopsis_en: >-
                    In the Bulgarian society where the word gender doesn’t have
                    a proper translation a family full of women opposes the
                    notions of mother and woman. This film deals with the absurd
                    circumstances around the ratification of the so-called
                    Istanbul convention focused on the gender-based violence.

        I am an independent film and TV consultant, working internationally with
        financing and development, policies and training, through my company P1
        Kemppinen. I evaluate content, train professionals and consult on
        policies. My skills in film and TV financing and project development
        stem from reading thousands of scripts and watching as many rough cuts.
        I have been giving notes and assessing financing and development plans
        in several roles during my career of 25 years. I have an MA in
        Communication Studies from University of Helsinki, a background in
        culture journalism and publishing before starting my film and television
        career at YLE in the mid-1990s and serving later at The Finnish Film
        Foundation (2005-2013) and as CEO of Nordisk Film & TV Fond (2013-2019).
        After that I wanted to establish my own business. I have been a member
        of Eurimages' Board of Management 2006-2013. I have initiated workshops
        like Nordic Genre Boost and Nordic Distribution Boost and worked for
        training organisations like EAVE. Now, besides P1 Kemppinen, I am a
        board member at the Swedish Film Institute and EWA Network.

        directing credits include major documentaries about finance, politics
        and history. Martin has also developed the ground-breaking music program
        Mégamix for La Sept and Arte, with 220 episodes from 1989 to 1994, that
        blazed a trail for subsequent arts programs.

        Martin is also a composer, who wrote the music for the opening and
        closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Albertville, as well as for
        numerous movies, including Stephen Frears’ Dirty Pretty Things.

        As a music producer he has worked with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of
        Led Zeppelin, Fela, Manu Dibango and dozens of other artists.

        As for now, he is exploring the subjects of work and new company models,
        since he’s made researches and directed his films Happiness at Work
        (2015), What Women Want at Work (2017) and Happiness at School (2021)

                    A handful of companies around the world are trying to invent
                    new organizational models and create a new concept of work:
                    doing away with the pyramid system, encouraging egalitarian
                    practices, scrapping controls and bosses, sharing
                    information, and so on. Shot in nine different companies in

                    crossroads of all important and pressing topics of our time:
                    politics, education, society, environment… and work. And
                    yet, despite statistics showing that women earn on average
                    18% less than men anywhere in the world, some companies are
                    actively trying to fight inequality and prejudice. What

        Germany’s Moritz Bleibtreu directs and stars in Cortex, a
        multi-dimensional action piece screening as an Estonian premiere, part
        of Rebels with A Cause and PÖFF’s New German Cinema strand. A
        supermarket security guard struggles through nested elevated-genre
        plotlines and inventive set pieces.


        “The look of the film gives a sense of submersion, disorientation and of
        diving deep into the subconscious.”

        (Wendy Ide, Screen Daily)


        After watching and experiencing CORTEX in the dark on the big screen you
        will be reminded of why we will always need movie theaters in our lives.
        A place where dreams truly come true – almost.


        Director of photography Thomas W. Kiennast (THE DARK VALLEY, 3 DAYS IN
        QUIBERON) and Paul Andexel (Postproduction Producer) discuss the magic
        and technique of creating a visually stunning and mind-bending
        psychological thriller with a little help from post production.

        In collaboration with ARRI Media.

        Olsberg•SPI’s Global Screen Production study provides compelling new
        evidence on the power of screen production to drive economic recovery
        from COVID-19. Jonathan Olsberg and Leon Forde from the firm will
        outline key findings from the research, which include the scale and
        growth of global screen production and its economic impact, the speed of
        production spend and the wide-ranging impacts that this activity has on
        business sectors outside of screen production. The study also examines
        the impact of COVID-19 on screen production. Followed by Q&A and
        discussion.

        In this panel we talk with three specialists about how to attract big
        film and TV productions to Europe, including how to photograph locations
        so they look attractive, and provide information to show they make sense
        for the production. We will do case studies on Christopher Nolan’s Tenet
        and HBO’s Chernobyl, looking at how the locations were first presented
        to their producers. The panel will be interesting for photographers,
        location scouts, production designers, line producers and other film
        professionals.

        Cinema capacity will be limited to 50% or less for the foreseeable
        future.  Despite these tough times audience data owned by cinemas and
        VoD platforms has the potential to help distribution sell more tickets
        and streams. The best data historically belongs to cinemas and VOD
        platforms, and they are often unwilling to share it. How can this
        opportunity be exploited?


        The session by Gruvi’s Vice President Asia Pacific & Central Europe -
        Nguyet Robbins is a follow up to a similarly titled and hugely popular
        workshop from this year’s Cannes Marche Du Film. Focusing at producers,
        the workshop presents case studies that highlight the value & importance
        of targeting audiences by their behavior rather than their interests.
        The lecture will also reveal how to own & exploit your own audience data
        to improve the engagement of your campaigns by 3 to 5 x.


        Your time is valuable but so is the information in this Session. Taking
        part will put you ahead of the curve and give you knowledge many of your
        rivals lack such as the ability to measure your campaign performance and
        predict Box office sales results before the premier date.


        Join Nguyet and the moderator Sten Saluveer (Storytek, Future Media
        Hubs) on Tuesday, 24 November, 9.30 CET / 10.30 Tallinn time to get a
        hands on peek into the latest development of cutting edge film marketing
        and beyond.

    description: >
        With the rise of self-marketing on social media everyone can become
        their own brand. But, how do you stand out in this jungle of identities?
        What makes it even more challenging is that a good brand nowadays is
        about so much more than people just remembering your name. A good brand
        identity should communicate your entire essence, your history, your
        personal story, and values all at once.  


        At the online seminar, she will talk about the basics of brand identity
        and trends in both marketing and presentation, bringing practical
        examples from both film and startup worlds.

        How music travels - the value of local in the context of global


        The era of digital has given more opportunities for smaller markets to
        reach international audiences, yet competition is fierce and the quest
        for global reach through digital platforms somewhat overshadows the
        inherent connection between artists and their ties with their local
        communities and audiences. What qualities make music to overlap across
        disparate societies and succeed as cross-cultural global products?


        The panel discussion will kick off with a short interview with Alan
        Davey and will include conversation with Kaisa Rönkkö, the Director of
        Music Finland, as well as Vaiko Eplik and Valgeir Sigurdsson who are
        both deeply involved in the process of music making and also the
        industry side or things.

        Does your festival have thousands of great photos in its archive waiting
        for the right time and opportunity to be used? How about finding out
        which filmmakers, sponsors, or partners attended certain events? Where
        were the most exciting photos taken, and on which occasions? Where are
        your sponsors' logos presented? Or do you want to give your festival
        photographers, marketing team, and audience a new tool to create great
        engagement videos automatically live from your event or the archive?


        If this sounds familiar, then FotoInMotion could be the right solution
        for you.

        FotoInMotion is a three-year research project powered by the Horizon
        2020 program that has brought together four European technology
        companies, Intrasoft, the Athens Technology Center, INESC and QdepQ

        and three power players from Europe's creative business, including the
        acclaimed photo agency NOOR, leading Italian fashion and accessories
        brand MARNI, Paris-based journalism agency Worldcrunch and the Black
        Nights Film Festival.

        Over three years, the team has built a prototype for a mobile and
        desktop platform that turns single photographs into high-quality videos
        through utilizing machine learning and the latest research on artificial
        intelligence by understanding who or what is in the picture and how to
        build videos out of the platform automatically.

        The FotoInMotion desktop & mobile tool allows both creative content
        producers and the innovative public to efficiently produce high-quality
        videos from still photography, relying on AI-driven templates.
        Automatically annotated photos turned to videos can be easily shared on
        social media or taken to other platforms for further video editing.


        Join the session at Industry@Tallinn to get to know how FotoInMotion
        works, what kinds of solutions and experiences are available for you and
        your event, and how to utilize FotoInMotion AI-powered tools to take
        your creativity, production, or event to the next level.

    titlePrivate: Writing for Virtual Reality Workshop  (pre-registration only)

        **"Writing for Virtual Reality"** is a course aimed at film writers,
        narrative designers, and dramaturgs interested in Virtual Reality who
        have little or no experience with the medium. The final goal is to
        create a 1-page Virtual Reality script during the session, considering
        technical and narrative challenges.


        “Writing for Virtual Reality” is a practical workshop in which
        participants learn the challenges of writing for cinematic virtual
        reality and develop a 1-page script.


        The aim of this workshop is to generate more awareness about the
        possibilities of the medium and to increase the number of screenwriters
        that are interested in creating stories for 360° media including VR, XR,
        and AR in the future. Although immersive media traces back to the last
        century, there is little practical literature for writers interested in
        participating in this medium.


        Ana Falcon will be the moderator for this event. The workshop was
        created as part of her current research in Virtual Reality screenwriting
        methodologies. She was selected for the 2008 Fusion Arts Exchange in
        Screenwriting and Film Production hosted by the University of Southern
        California and the US State Department. In 2017, she was distinguished
        with a Young Creators FONCA grant from the Mexican Culture Ministry. In
        2019, she was a screenwriting finalist in the Watersprite International
        Student Film Festival hosted by the University of Cambridge.


        In addition to their 1-page, guests will be requested to participate in
        several practical activities designed to sensibilize them to the
        challenges of virtual reality including POV, cues, and technological
        limitations.


        The duration of the workshop is 3 hours.


        To participate in the workshop, please sign up via email
        info.industry@poff.ee by Wednesday 25th of November.


        **The workshop is organized by Tartu Center for Creative Industries,
        Tartu Film Fund and Tartu Science Park.**

        series acclaimed abroad, and Scandinavian TV producers and showrunners
        discuss the most efficient possibilities of cross-countries
        collaboration.

        There are several adaptations of Scandi TV series in Russia but there is
        no one co-production. Even TV series which includes Russian elements in
        the story (for example, Finnish “Sorjonen”) are not made in
        co-production. Is it too complicated for the producers or is not
        efficient?

        **Online Pitching: Tips for adapting to the virtual environment**


        Although pitching opportunities and settings are rapidly changing, the
        underlying rules and dynamics really aren’t. Your audience not only
        needs to understand the essence of the project, but even more
        importantly, the capabilities and qualities that you and your team bring
        to the table.

        Whether your pitch is a pre-recorded video or an online real-time
        interview, it’s not only the content that matters. Invisible factors
        such as likability, credibility, and trustworthiness still play an
        incredibly crucial role in influencing the decision making process.

        The main challenge is how to get your message and vision across, stay
        naturally confident, and simultaneously charm your viewer - while
        basically staring into a camera lens.

        The focus of this informal session is on how to prepare your pitch and
        fine-tune your delivery, specifically for the virtual environment.

        Whether it is a book, a feature film, a previous series, a real-life
        persona or a combination of several of these pre-existing ideas or
        stories, the development process of series based on an existing IP have
        some specific features that perhaps differ from starting a project from
        scratch. In this panel discussion, we'll be talking to Cyril Tysz (Skam
        France), Ben Harris (Young Wallander), Ben Morris (Mr Selfridge) and
        Gabor Krigler (Golden Life).

        At youth film festivals controversial films ofter raise the questions -
        which audience should be allowed to see which films or if these films
        should have age restrictions. Boundaries have shifted as the content
        platforms are getting more and more accessible - cinemas, festival
        screenings, TV, streaming platforms and Internet. In some countries the
        limiting of visual content is not specifically regulated, yet in other
        countries it is.

        In the panel we will raise some important questions…


        What are the limitations for youth films nowadays?

        Is suitability for children and youth essentially a matter of opinion
        and depends on personal expectations and definitions of childhood?

        How important is cultural pretext in defining youth film?
         
        Panel discussion takes place in cooperation with Just Film Festival and
        ECFA (European Children's Film Association)

        public financial support to foreign film producers. Launching of federal

        In her lecture, Wendy Bernfeld, founder and Managing Director of
        consultancy / digital agency Rights Stuff (www.rights-stuff.com),
        provides a detailed presentation on what VOD platforms are out there in
        the international digital sector buying and sometimes funding films. She
        goes beyond the usual big streamers like Netflix / Amazon, to introduce
        and outline various head-on competitors (including telecom and cable
        companies)  
         
        In addition, Filmmakers could be especially interested in the
        accessible, complementary ""theme focused"" VOD services, who are buying
        in specific niches, genres  and across multiple ‘windows’ and business
        models including TVOD (like iTunes);  SVOD (like Netflix), AVOD (like
        Youtube) and hybrids (like Amazon). She also highlights the
        practicalities for Baltics rights holders, including outreach to
        platforms, the role of middle-persons, and deals / financials. She also
        turns to new productions: including digital co-pro and Originals trends,
        as well newer production formats (short form series, VR / cross
        platform, etc)


        Lecture will be 2 hours followed with the Q&A moderated by Toomas
        Luhats.

        Co-organised with the Creative Europe MEDIA Desk Estonia.

        The global pandemic has had an enormous impact on cultural events and
        the place of film festivals in the film ecosystem as somewhere to
        finance projects in development, showcase new films and engage with
        audiences.


        In this conversation the **Independent Cinema Office** brings together
        Giulia D’Agnolo Vallan, US Programmer at Venice International Film
        Festival, Natalie Brenner, Partner and Head of Sales at Metro
        International Entertainment, and Marija Razgutė, Producer at M-Films, to
        share their experiences since the pandemic started. They'll be
        discussing what the main challenges have been over the past few months
        and how some of the new ways of working may continue when the pandemic
        is over. There will be a chance for the audience to ask questions. This
        webinar is part of the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Events programme.


        The ICO’s Developing Your Film Festival development programme has been
        running since 2011 and has trained more than 250 people from 53
        different countries and 197 festivals. The course offers a unique
        opportunity for film festival professionals to consider their long-term
        strategic vision, meet their peers, and respond to a constantly changing
        landscape.


        This webinar will be live captioned, we will provide instructions on how
        to access the captions at the start of the event.

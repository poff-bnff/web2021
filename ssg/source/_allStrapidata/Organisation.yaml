            Eborn (Big Screen Award IFFR), HAMADA by Eloy Domínguez Serén (IDFA
            2018) and MADRE by Simón Mesa Soto (Short Film Competition Cannes
            2016).

            Momento is working on a slate of projects including the drama MADAME
            LUNA written by Maurizio Braucci (GOMORRA) and directed by Daniel
            Espinosa (SAFE HOUSE), the thriller KAUTOKEINO by Isabella Eklöf as
            well as the documentary LEAVING JESUS by Ellen Fiske.


            The producers are part of the producers’ networks EAVE, ACE and
            Eurodoc. In 2018, David Herdies was Producer on the Move in Cannes.

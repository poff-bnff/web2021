    synopsis: >
        Erratic and headstrong LAURA (44) hasn’t reconciled with her dying
        mother before it was too late and sets out to ease her guilty conscience
        by bringing a message from her mother to her spiteful and estranged
        grandfather in her native Faroe Islands. This becomes a difficult
        journey filled with fall outs and misunderstandings, but ends up being
        her way to inner peace, closeness with her grandfather and an encounter
        with the biological father she never knew about.

    synopsis: >-
        Based on the Hailak short story and other works by Polish writer with
        experience of Seberian exile Wacław Sieroszewski, the plot revolves
        around poor Yakut peasant couple Khabdzhiy and Keremes struggling to
        survive in the taiga area of the most remove East corner of Russian
        Empire at the end of XIX century. After the death of the second new-born
        child the couple obediently get back to their chores to get ready to
        lengthy and exhausting winter. The local Yakut ruler orders the family
        to admit to their house the Russian political convict Kostya. The worlds
        of the family and the Russian unwelcome quest are colliding from the
        first days due to completely polar backgrounds. Despite the mutual
        challenge of the household against surrounding wild nature, Kostya
        gradually settles in and claims the position of the master of the house.

        A novice attorney, Zeynep, while defending a group of pottymouth
        protesters, cannot hold herself and laughs at policemen as they
        repeatedly ask if a slogan was chanted at a protest. Because of her
        impulsive laugh, she gets crucified and goes behind the bars for
        "insulting national values".  A French documentarist with Turkish
        origins, Adrianne, follows her story to catch a leap in her career. How
        could somebody get arrested for laughing? Unaware of the levels that the
        political tension has reached in the country, she also gets arrested for
        planning a coup on twitter. A year later, they find each other in
        France. Adrianne has become famous, she has her own show on TV. Zeynep
        is at first greeted like an apostle of democracy. But soon she realises
        that as a refugee, she only has to visit new courthouses, until she
        loses her every last identity.

    synopsis: >
        Los Angeles, late ‘40s. Our heroine is a young woman at the peak of her
        career in the movies. However, under all the glamour and fame, she feels
        trapped into a patriarchal system which concedes her no artistic
        freedom. But her life is destined to change when she stumbles upon an
        unknown European film screened in a small, dilapidated cinema: the
        rawness of its story, the genuineness of its images, are nothing she’s
        ever seen in Hollywood. Captured and irreparably fascinated, she will
        soon make a choice that will forever change the course of her career: to
        leave behind all the glitz of her life in America, and travel to Europe
        to meet the director who brought to life such an unrecognised
        masterpiece.
    directorsNote: >
        The film will center on the romantic tribulations of our two
        protagonists, caught in a web of guilt, desire and escape. There is an
        austere beauty to the story. We want to capture the  adventure  and 
        challenge  of  our heroine’s  journey  –  what  could  make  a woman of
        1940s Hollywood sacrifice her fame, fortune and marriage? Was it love
        for a man, or the artistic freedom he offers? Or is she, in fact,
        escaping something she wasn’t prepared to confront?


        Our heroine tries to take action, follows her desires in a world where
        women were restricted, judged and often forced into conformity. Breaking
        from the expectations of how she should conduct herself takes bravery
        and determination. There are pertinent similarities to now, with the
        shift towards greater representation of diversity, and the #MeToo
        movement. Our film prefigures some of these issues and sensibilities.
        Can a woman break with the system and thrive? Can she do what men have
        done for years and not be destroyed?

    synopsis: >-
        A young Muslim girl flees her small Lebanese village to escape her
        mother’s drinking and start over in a big city. There she meets a
        charismatic European man, thinking she has found salvation, peace, and
        love in him. But it turns out to be fatally wrong. Her fate is shown
        through a lens of Lebanese events, her experiences, internal tragedy,
        rejection of her religion, loss of loved ones, deception, betrayal,
        recovery and hope. The originality of the idea comes from our story
        being told through a prism of a Middle Eastern country. The project
        participated in Marche du film Proof of Concept pitch

        Laine’s (20) parents separate – her father becomes emotionally estranged
        and her brother Bruno (10) is having trouble at school, but she isn’t
        ready to take up mother’s duties. On a drugged-up rave, Laine befriends
        seasoned partygoer Gunda (21). Their relationship suddenly and
        unexpectedly becomes intimate. The neon spring of Riga’s techno scene
        blossoms, and Laine begins to question her sexuality and identity at a
        time when her family is falling apart. She finds her escape in the
        drugs, clubs, festivals and afterparties as she struggles to hold
        together her dissolving relationship with reality.

    synopsis: >
        FALL is a psychological horror film about Doc, a young doctor who
        decides to make a move and trades his busy city life for the remote town
        of Fall where he can take the place of the recently deceased doctor.
        When he arrives at the doctor's house, the local police chief advises
        him not to wait too long with visiting his new patients. These visits
        all become extremely remarkable as they immediately tell him their
        innermost secrets. Even the nature surrounding Fall seems to behave
        weirdly. But no matter how bizarre his new environment is, Doc finds the
        calm he was looking for. Until one day he makes a gruesome discovery at
        home and the story takes a very dark turn. What once seemed as a
        peaceful place now turns out to be a pitch black retreat where no one is
        innocent.

        A young woman returns from treatment at a psychiatric hospital and has
        to tackle the prejudice of her family, especially one of her brothers,
        to find herself at home in her own home.
    lookingFor: Producer/Director
    synopsis: >
        HELEENE (25) returns home from treatment for depression, only to find
        her antagonist brother MADIS (35) has come home after a bitter divorce.
        Heleene’s dream of making herself feel at home again is crushed. The
        eldest brother, JAAN (39) and his wife MARIETTA (44), seem powerless in
        the battle between Heleene and Madis, while dodging the painful subject
        of their own – childlessness. Madis accuses Heleene of causing the car
        accident that killed their parents years ago, until things by chance are
        revealed in a different light.

        After learning from his younger brother Pashka about their Father’s
        mysterious death, Yegor returns to his native village after many years
        of absence. It turns out that the entire inheritance, a farm with a
        small livestock of cows and a piece of land has to be sacrificed for
        paying off his father’s debts to the local entrepreneur Gleb. Pashka is
        dead set against killing the cows and selling the land to Gleb. A
        quarrel breaks out between the brothers. Yegor asks some local guys to
        help take the cows to the slaughterhouse in a nearby village, but Pashka
        manages to lead the whole herd away in an unknown direction, under cover
        of night.

    synopsis: >-
        Melchior Wakenstede is a clever and curious apothecary who, in addition
        to healing the sick, solves murders that shake the town. In a medieval
        world, where people look for signs of God or the Devil in everything,
        Melchior’s detective work appears to be truly magical. Melchior has a
        knack for noticing traitorous details and understands the darkest
        desires of the human soul. He knows, better than anyone else, that sin
        is waiting at the door, and temptation can poison even the most noble of
        intentions.

    synopsis: >-
        It’s the summer of 1990. The Soviet Union is teetering on the verge of
        collapse and the little Baltic nations struggle to take back their lost
        independence. The Soviet Union`s basketball championship is set to begin
        on the backdrop of a deeply divided society.

        The Estonian team Kalev faces a momentous decision. With Estonian
        independence seemingly within reach, a rising tide of public opinion
        opposes the Estonian national team’s articipation in the USSR’s
        championship. As professional athletes, the team makes the unpopular
        choice. Against all odds, Kalev makes it to the finals.

    synopsis: "16-year old Sasha has just finished school in Kaliningrad and does not know what he wants to do in life. He likes to draw but his mother does not believe it to be a serious career choice. Sasha avoids relations with girls, as he is afraid to hurt them, like his father did, leaving his mother, when he was three. During the last summer of his adolescence, he meets\_Zhenya, an unusual girl he falls in love with, and his father whom he does not know. Sasha needs to figure out how to get along with his father and not to hurt his mother, whether he should stay in his local city, go to the Arts University in Moscow or follow\_Zhenya\_who has just got into a university in Milan. After many hesitations, Sasha makes the decision to follow\_Zhenya, but she has already left for Milan without leaving her address. Sasha decides to fly to Milan to find\_Zhenya. It’s the first decision he takes himself and his mother is finally ready to accept his adult choices."
    directorsNote: >
        I would like to explore the theme of coming of age in Russia today. On
        one hand, the story is universal, as a young person today is overwhelmed
        by the variety of choices in life, to the extent that he or she is
        unable to make a choice. On the other hand, Russian boys and girls are
        raised by their mothers (often without fathers), who survived through
        challenging times of the 90s and have preconceived ideas about safe
        career choices. They want to protect their children against the mistakes
        they made.


        For me, coming of age brings the ability to take decisions, however
        right or wrong they are, and be responsible for them. In this film,
        three main characters pass through a coming of age. Sasha is ready to
        shape his life himself, his father accepts his paternal role and his
        mother is ready to let her son go and become an adult.

        The film is a message to both young people and their parents, that it’s
        never too late to change your life. Coming of age may take your whole
        life but it’s worth it.

    title_en: Afterparty
    budget: 3400000
    synopsis: >-
        AFTERPARTY is a contemporary drama series that explores the world of
        Lucija and her best friends, Ruža, Maja and Iva, as they navigate
        through their late twenties while the political aspirations of the
        ultra-conservative movement threaten their sexual freedom, health and
        self-esteem. In desperate need of money, Lucija begins working for a
        warmhearted pro-life activist Anđela, which puts Lucija’s relationship
        with her best friend and lover Maja to the test. 

        When Iva gets pregnant and reluctantly decides to have an abortion, the
        gap between the girls widens and the time comes to take responsibility;
        to reassess their beliefs and values, to give up jobs or boyfriends, and
        as in Ruža’s case, to face their buried traumas. Challenged to sustain
        their lifestyle, they fear not only the loss of ownership of their body,
        but even more so the loss of each other.

    synopsis: "Kiev, 1911. A 12-year-old Russian boy Andrei Yushchinskiy is murdered. Despite the police suspecting a known gang of thieves to be the perpetrators of the crime, the case, under pressure from the right-wing political circles, takes a grotesque turn: the prevailing line of enquiry becomes that of a ritual murder, allegedly committed by fanatical Jews. And a lowly clerk named Menahem Beilis is charged with murder on the basis of circumstantial evidence, and the trial is held in 1913.\_\nThe main character of our story is Vera Cheberyak. She is not an essentially bad person, but circumstances make her become a dealer of stolen goods. She wants to have a different life, but how can you overcome your destiny? Then a new figure, Vaska the Switchman, enters the scene, she’s attracted to him – both as a man and as a symbol of hope for a better life. Even though she suspects him of being a police agent, Vera lets him inside her gang. But at the decisive moment, she chooses getting stuck in the groove and finds herself trapped, as one crime leads to another. The character of the police investigator Vasily Dmitrievich, whom we first meet as a criminal known as Vaska the Switchman, is partially based on the story of a real police detective Krasovsky, the investigator in the Yushchinsky case. Their love/hate relationship lies at the core of the film."
    directorsNote: >
        Our film does not purport to provide an historically accurate account of
        the Beilis case. Rather, it’s the authors’ own version of it, a
        modernist cinematic novel if you like, in which real people and events
        are mixed with plot assumptions, fictional characters, and even some
        elements of the grotesque. 


        The film tells the story of how one brutal murder transforms the social
        and political landscape of the Russian Empire. But, at the same time,
        it’s about so many other things: choosing one’s fate, the role art and
        culture play in our lives, the price and meaning of sacrifice, the
        conflict between the old and the new. 


        This method of constructing the film allows us to feel deeply for the
        characters and understand their state of mind and motives, as well as
        life in Russia in general at the time. It also, of course, helps to
        highlight certain parallels with present-day events, thus making the
        film relevant today. We believe that the artistic approach we have
        chosen allows us to make a film that’s original, engrossing and
        multi-layered.

    synopsis: >
        Aliya, an 18-year-old recent immigrant from Ukraine, finds meaning in
        her recently discovered Jewish identity and feelings of patriotism
        towards her newly adopted country, where she trains to become a drill
        instructor in the Israeli army. After weeks of intense physical and
        psychological training at the desert base, her company is given
        forty-eight hours leave before their final exam, and Aliya returns to
        her family in Tel Aviv. Aliya, who is determined to have fun, heads into
        the city for a night out but ends up being sexually assaulted by her
        date. She then must return to the military base but struggles to
        complete her course, as she re-evaluates her values, beliefs, and place
        in Israeli society.
    directorsNote: >
        In its heart, deeply personal, ALIYA is a coming-of-age story, yet it is
        one that also encapsulates the narrative of an entire country, in which
        interpersonal relationships are used as a metaphor for violence between
        nations. The main argument that the film is making is that a militarised
        society, one which is in a prolonged state of armed conflict, is
        inherently violent, not only towards its enemies but towards its own
        people as well. Put simply, the violence one inflicts upon others always
        ends up being inflicted upon oneself. While taking place in Israel,
        ALIYA is a universally important and timely film that touches on themes
        that concern all people, regardless of race, gender, or background. I
        hope that by turning these ideas into film, audiences all over the world
        will gain insight not only into the double-edged nature of violence in
        the Middle East, as it manifests itself within the lives of Israel’s
        young soldiers, but into their own lives as well, whoever they are, and
        wherever they may be.

        Canada, 1918. The world is in the grip of Spanish flu. When their mother
        is infected with the virus, Marilee (13) and James (8), the children of
        Lithuanian immigrants, are forced to fend for themselves. In a log
        cabin, far from the raging pandemic, they await the return of their
        father from the European Front. To prevent her brother from going back
        home, Marilee tells him the old folktale of Tinginys, a dangerous
        creature who is said to wreak havoc in the woods. All alone and full of
        fear, the two must learn to tell the difference between fantasy and real
        danger and distinguish those to be trusted from those to be feared.

    synopsis: >-
        Kyiv/Ukraine, late 90s. Tonya, a 15-year-old girl is moving to a new
        school. On her first day, Dzhura, the local enfant terrible and the most
        popular boy in school, falls in love with her. His attention helps Tonya
        to get into his gang of pranksters. Its members mostly parent each other
        while their real parents are focused on surviving in the post-Soviet
        economic and social crisis.

        Her secret is revealed soon - she has a stalker from her previous school
        who wants to bring her back into their traumatic relationship.
        Otherwise, he threatens to kill her. The group led by Dzhura defends
        Tonya from her pursuer, punishing him. Tonya spends days and nights with
        her new friends, forgetting about school and dragging her younger sister
        Nadia into adult life.

        However, Sanya, an informal leader of the gang, is not able to resist
        his attraction to Tonya, his best friend's girlfriend. Tonya and Sanya
        share a secret that eventually destroys the gang, but helps all of them
        to grow up.
    directorsNote: >
        Watching my teenage son, I recognise the same worries and troubles I had
        at his age. For me, it was the last bit of the 90s, letting me, as a
        teen, be alone with myself without the supervision of my parents. 


        The atmosphere of the last years before digital communication is catchy.
        Years of sensuality without any obstacles - in shared cigarettes and
        cuddling in school basements, in brief touches and escaping to the
        summer house. The sensual feeling of not being controlled! Everything is
        vibrating with hormones and imaginary freedom: pleasant, scary, strange,
        shameful and cool at the same time. 



        It's a coming-of-age drama with a rough, edgy, yet romantic tone, with
        emotional visual storytelling. Powerful and compressed. With close-ups
        dedicated to tensions and feelings. With the camera as an additional
        character running through the gang. Syncopal edit is a virtue, along
        with the music and colours, like our collective memories of the 90s.

    synopsis: >-
        In the spring of 1989, the news of a horrible murder terrifies a small
        town in Romania: the body of a little girl who had gone missing several
        days earlier is found scattered all over the area. The two police
        officers called in to conduct the investigation gradually move from
        searching simple people’s homes, to abattoirs and interrogating mentally
        challenged suspects, gradually uncovering a latent strain of evil buried
        within the secrets of a community consumed by silence and fear.
    directorsNote: >
        I accidentally came across the story of Alina Lucaci, while reading the
        Romanian press from the early 2000s, while documenting another subject.
        On one page of a local newspaper, I saw the photograph of an elderly
        woman, her lost gaze staring into the camera lens. She was the little
        girl’s mother, Cezaria. In 2003, when the interview was made, the woman
        was still waiting to find out who had killed her child and why. As the
        father of two children, I felt some of her anger and despair.

        The moment coincided with a time of major changes I was undergoing at
        the time. I had just become the father of a little girl, while my son,
        then aged seven, was becoming increasingly independent: he would go out
        to the park with his friends alone, go shopping or to school alone. The
        thought that you can see your child going out the front door, on a day
        like any other, only to never see him or her again after that moment,
        triggered the idea to write 'Milk Teeth'.

    synopsis: >-
        5 Days of Life of Kazimir Malevich, a renowned Ukrainian artist, who
        fights the Soviet regime for the right to create art freely. Malevich
        presents his most provocative painting, The Black Square, for public
        view and creates a major uproar challenging the Soviet government with
        the questions: Does a painting carry a hidden message? Could it be a
        political prophecy? His opponents, fellow artists, do not understand his
        art. The women in his life know they would always be his second
        priority. 5 hectic Days, to explicate the interchangeable connections
        between: time and space, art and politics, love and inspiration.

    synopsis: >+
        Katie, overcome by grief after losing her son Joel, desperately seeks
        meaning and is eventually led to an ancient ritual her son was studying
        before his death. Following a series of increasingly unsettling
        breadcrumbs she believes that her son might still be alive in a parallel
        universe. As Katie's obsession grows, her relationship with her husband
        Noah, who's also struggling with the loss, falls apart. With nothing to
        lose Katie follows Joel’s footsteps and performs the ritual.

        After waking up she sees signs that she's traveled into a universe where
        her son is still alive. Things also seem to be back to normal with her
        husband. But, just as life seems to be going well, it again falls apart,
        as she struggles against slipping back into her universe - the reality
        she dreads.

    synopsis: >-
        Imagine you’re at a job interview and you’ve just been offered a
        position with the most inhumane conditions you can think of: you have to
        be available 24h a day, no breaks, no sitting, always ready, very little
        sleep and no remuneration. Seems like a job that couldn’t possibly
        exist. It is a job done by millions of people every day: mothers. Then
        there are those mothers who, out of necessity or out of a desire for
        independence and personal fulfillment, also have a job outside the home.
        And so, the fatigue, stress, anxiety increase and amplify. Feeling
        anxious yet? Well, now let&#39;s raise the stakes. Some of them do both
        jobs by themselves. They are single mothers, the ones for whom the word
        ‘multitasking’ seems to have been invented. #MALAMAMMA is a series that

    synopsis: >
        Physicist Emily has invented time travel and found the love of her life.
        But Emily is not only brilliant, she is also seriously unstable. After a
        heated argument with her husband, she just snaps and jumps back in time
        to give her marriage another try. But to do that, she has to take the
        place of her past self and kill Emily past - which proves harder than
        imagined. On top of that, her future husband follows her to the past. He
        won’t give up on her so easily. Now Emily is stuck and has to deal with
        two versions of her husband and another version of herself, discovering
        things about herself, she'd never wanted to know…

    synopsis: >-
        In 1935, the former silent cinema and theatre star in Germany, Marija
        Leiko, goes to the Soviet Union to take over the care of her
        granddaughter. The way back to Latvia leads through Moscow where her
        former friends, revolutionaries of 1905, now commissars of the Stalinist
        regime, talk her into staying in Moscow to perform with the Latvian
        theatre. Soon enough she becomes aware of the schizophrenic and violent
        character of the new regime. Leonīds Zakovskis, deputy head of the NKVD,
        becomes her admirer and romantic suitor. A year later, the
        NKVD-organised “national operation” begins, and Zakovskis is put in
        charge of it. Should the actress admit to anti-Soviet activities, it
        would prove the Latvian disloyalty to the regime.

        Albeit in the dark about the fate of her granddaughter, kidnapped by the
        NKVD, Leiko cannot admit to “crimes” she has not committed. She is
        forced to play her life’s most tragic role – an innocent victim, along
        with thousands of other Latvians in Soviet Russia.
    directorsNote: >
        Marija Leiko should be considered one of the most important
        personalities in Latvian cultural history who owes her successful career
        to German theatres and cinema. In her life’s journey, several plots
        emerge, allowing for very different experiences (lives) and serving as a
        testimony to an individual’s unforgiving relationship to the great
        processes of history. The film provides an opportunity to remind
        ourselves of important personalities of the first half of the 20th
        century and to raise the level of discussion on the greatest Latvian
        genocide in history when approximately 20 thousand Latvians were killed
        in less than a year. Leiko’s life story is related to different powers
        and political convictions, therefore narrating this story means
        generalising about the relationship between political power and art and
        murderous “blindness” of totalitarianism. Yet the main role in this
        story is played by the motif of love - for life, mother’s love and
        actresses love of her work.

    synopsis: >-
        Year 2052. In a world of constant daylight, people hardly sleep and
        never dream. Zola, a young computer programmer, unravels the secrets of
        the new sleep order as she reclaims the night and the forgotten cave of
        dreams.
    directorsNote: >
        I would like to explore the complicated web of relations between
        technology and humanity, focusing on how capitalism turned sleep into a
        problem. While the night is still a place to take refuge, it has become
        a final frontier for multinational corporations and governments. Due to
        the increasing global uncertainty of freedom, I came to realise what a
        great luxury it is to be safely asleep at night, or not to be working a
        night shift in a factory.


        But is the night really keeper of our sleeps, the final threshold that
        capitalism has not yet conquered? Or is the night still an imaginary
        place where forces of good and evil can be found? 


        In this context, I am interested in my main character’s arc from a
        conformist to a rebel. In a society that describes strength through
        physical vigour and productivity, she becomes a fighter only when she
        accepts her emotions, which is something that has always been defined as
        a feminine weakness.

    synopsis: >-
        Maria comes back to her former life after checking herself out of
        rehabilitation clinic, where she was treated for panic attacks. To get
        back her position as lead researcher and convince her family she is
        fine, she hides her breakdowns that manifest as crazy hallucinations.
        However, hiding her special condition while also competing for a
        neuroscience project and love from her family is more difficult than
        she’d thought.

    title_en: The Occupant
    titleOriginal: The Occupant
    synopsis: >
        When Danny survives a mysterious helicopter crash, she tries to radio
        for help but receives a desperate plea from an injured pilot that
        crashed nearby, who pleads with her not to radio for help but to bring
        him medical supplies herself. Believing the injured pilot to be an
        American on a top secret spy-flight, Danny agrees to hold off on
        radioing the Russian authorities, and hikes toward the crash site with
        medical supplies. But after injuring her leg, and growing suspicious
        that the injured pilot is not who he says he is, Danny turns back, but
        discovers the pilot can remotely manipulate nature and perception, and
        will stop at nothing to force her to come to him. Now a wounded Danny
        must escape the harsh environment and the sinister pilot’s
        manipulations, or be forced to confront him and discover the horrifying
        truth about what he really wants from her.

    synopsis: >
        At the height of winter in an isolated mountain cabin, seven elite yet
        dysfunctional lawyers discover that this time their team-building is not
        a reward, but a punishment for their misbehaviour.

        Someone stole 650.000€ from the owner of their law firm. If they want to
        return back to the city, they have to play a teambuilding game and find
        the culprit. For the game’s sake everyone’s mobile phones are
        confiscated. There is no internet access either. 

        A whirlwind of calamitous events ensues: the cabin caretaker gets
        fatally wounded, a snowstorm cuts the road off, and their phones are
        nowhere to be found. After the snowstorm passes, the self-absorbed
        lawyers realise they have become dependent on the only other human being
        around - a mysterious Foreigner. Slowly the power and status hierarchy
        starts to shift and break down. But who is the thief? We’re in for a
        shocking and poignant surprise.

    synopsis: >-
        Sergei and Natalia are political asylum-seekers who fled Russia for
        Sweden with their two daughters, Katja and Alina, hoping for a new life.
        Those hopes are crushed when their application is rejected. Their
        daughter Katja, traumatised by this episode, collapses and falls into a
        coma: a condition known as Resignation Syndrome or Apathy. Their parents
        will try everything to create the atmosphere of safety, stability and
        hope that their daughters need to feel in order to wake up.
    directorsNote: >-
        Apathy or Hopelessness. Two possible titles for one film. An allegory
        for the society of today, at a time where people’s futures are
        determined by rules and laws which are, sadly, incompatible with values
        like solidarity and compassion. My protagonists are just that: victims
        of a political situation.


        Katja and Alina are forced to grow up in just such an environment, where
        feelings of fear and insecurity have replaced the joy and serenity one
        associates with childhood.


        Over the last few years, more than 600 children have been diagnosed with
        the syndrome in Sweden alone. It is heartbreaking to see these children
        ‘sleeping’; lying apathetic, like modern day Sleeping Beauties, waiting
        for a Prince charming to wake them up. This prince has a name: Hope. And
        hope is precisely what Katja’s and Alina’s parents, Nathalie and Sergei,
        are called upon to provide for their stricken Daughters.


        Is happiness, in the end, something that is ours to create, no matter
        how grim tomorrow might seem?

    synopsis: >-
        Tokyo, 2002. After years in psychiatric prison, Jeremy Bannon arrives
        from the UK to find the man who slaughtered and cannibalized his sister
        Serena 20 years ago and remains free. Jeremy treasures his childhood
        Walkman recordings of Serena and vows to kill Teppei Hamazaki on tape on
        the anniversary of her murder, in tribute. Hamazaki, once a profitable
        cult figure, is now a destitute recluse. Jeremy poses as a crime book
        researcher and hires ambitious guide Hana. As Hana helps Jeremy get
        closer to realizing the brutal revenge fantasy playing out in his mind,
        her kindness awakens a sense of normality in him for the first time.
        Financially desperate, Hamazaki schemes for a media blitz on the
        anniversary. When they come face to face, chaos ensues but Jeremy’s
        vengeance ultimately takes an unanticipated form.

    synopsis: >-
        Tallinn, Estonia, 2020. Nicola, an 8-year-old boy, is in deep political
        crisis. All over the world populist and sovranist parties are
        flourishing, while the consent to the International left wing is
        strongly falling. From the capital of Estonia, freed from Communism and
        presently an example of modernism and innovation, a flashback begins in
        the 1980s in Italy, maybe the only western nation where Communism really
        worked and is still idolized nowadays.

    synopsis: >
        Year 2004. Naples, Italy. A 12-year-old girl, Aurora, is sent to collect
        a teddy bear from a shop, an action that will be fatal for the girl. Whe
        finds herself in the cross-fire of a Camorra shootout and is hit by a
        bullet. Little Aurora wakes up in a fantastic and surreal world. She
        seems fine, but she has lost her voice: she can’t talk anymore. In a
        scenario of urban desolation and criminal life, she will find weird
        special tricks, grotesque characters and almost ‘magical’ beings. Aurora
        is in a sort of parallel reality in which the only thing she desires the
        most is to get back home and have her voice back.

    logline: >-
        Little Red Helmet is a modern reinterpretation of Little Red Riding Hood
        – a story about an 11-year old girl who decides not to grow up and goes
        on a hunger strike in an attempt to rebel against the world of grown
        ups.
    lookingFor: 'Producer, Director'
    synopsis: >
        Who the hell came up with the idea that childhood is the happiest time
        of your life? Bullshit! Not if you’re a girl who’s just turned 11 and
        your parents moved to the middle of nowhere. Not if your dad is
        depressive, and your mum is in denial. Not if your new classmates hate
        you and the only person who understands you is your sick grandma. Not if
        your life’s dream is to become a firewoman, and your only friend is an
        imaginary wolf. Did we already mention that grown ups suck? Well, if
        you’re that girl, your only option might be to go on a hunger strike to
        avoid growing up and becoming one of them…

    synopsis: >-
        When Akbar is unexpectedly released from prison after serving ten years
        for killing his wife, his son Khalid wants to find out why he did it.
        Khalid’s married girlfriend Ayan - whom he secretly meets in the museum
        where she works at night - urges him to get closer to his father in
        order to unravel the mysteries of his past. While Khalid tries to coax
        Akbar into telling him about what exactly happened over a decade ago in
        the apartment he now shares with him, Khalid and Ayan become
        increasingly intrigued by the charismatic ex-criminal. Akbar reveals
        nothing about his secret as he starts to meddle with Khalid’s personal
        and professional life. When Khalid finally finds out about the details
        of his mother’s death, the sensitive painter and tombstone engraver is
        shocked to find out that he is more like his father than he ever
        realised.
    directorsNote: >-
        Families have always fascinated me, as micro-models of society. In my
        first film, I portrayed a generational family conflict from the father's
        point of view. In this new film, I focus on the perspective of the son,
        Khalid, the anti-hero of a changing society. Khalid no longer sees
        himself as a Muslim or an Asian, but he doesn’t realise he is far from
        the cosmopolitan, artistic atheist he aspires to be. The return of his
        father Akbar shakes up Khalid’s life. Khalid is more like Akbar than he
        wants to admit. I plan to capture Khalid’s state of mind by using a
        static camera and framing that emphasise Khalid’s alienation from
        himself and the world around him. Dialogues will be subtextual and the
        sound will reflect the conflict between the constraints of the old world
        and the chaos of the new world, that is often as cold as marble.

        takes much more for them in order to be together.

        Kristina is a twenty-four years old trainee in a consulting firm who
        tries to escape boredom in Aikido trainings. Her single mother, Marina,
        whose life is entirely concentrated on her daughter, works as a real
        estate agent by day and writes erotic novels by night. Their neighbour
        Pavel, a young scientist who is preparing to leave for the Arctic,
        spends most of his time at home with a hamster, watching a video blog of
        an eleven years old Alice, a lonely child who is looking for friends.
        The lives of the four of them are going to intersect for the time of an
        autumn when the air is cold and everyone is waiting for the first snow.

    synopsis: >-
        Michail’s life purpose is to look after his little brother Robin and his
        alcoholic father Bo. That is until he meets Ines. With Michail engulfed
        by love, Robin loses his footing and begins to freefall. After a
        tenement house burns down, with fifteen dead, Robin is found guilty of
        arson. Michail blames himself for neglecting Robin and sees it as his
        responsibility to save his family. The only problem is that neither
        Robin nor Bo wants to be saved.
    directorsNote: >-
        Ever since my very first short films, I have repeatedly told the stories
        of children and youths. I’m interested in how people during these
        crucial years – most often in a state of emotional chaos – are shaped
        and try to find their identity. We are often during these years placed
        at life-altering crossroads with huge and difficult dilemmas. A lot is
        at stake and new emotions need to be managed for the very first time.
        Through the choices we make during both crises and euphoric moments, we
        shape our identity.

    synopsis: >-
        Having lived in the capital city for many years, a successful political
        consultant, Aldar, returns to a far-away home to search for his mother
        who disappeared in the Steppes. When he ﬁnds her, they make the journey
        that they didn't have time to take while she was still alive.
    directorsNote: >-
        … try to imagine that. Mother is the motherland: the motherland that
        gave you life and nourishes you with its energy. The motherland, which
        we betray in our thoughts, renounce it, thereby destroying ourselves
        from the inside instead of accepting and loving it only because it's the
        mother.

        The White Road is about the feelings that go against reality. About what
        is in the air, but is impossible to touch or to see. Something that we
        seem to see, but it can be just a figment of our imagination. On the
        other hand, we give so much attention to these feelings, we rely on this
        invisible sensation, we trust it more than the real arguments.

    synopsis: >-
        Tuomas visits his hometown in the North of Finland after five years of
        absence. His world turns upside-down when he accidentally meets his
        5-year-old daughter who was born after he left. Tuomas is touched by
        love. He wants a fresh start, but he has to confront the life he left
        behind: a judgemental father and a hurt ex-spouse. Tuomas wants to
        become a decent man in the eyes of others so he hides his troubling past
        as a mercenary. Tuomas fights to be accepted by the family he abandoned,
        even though he has a hard time accepting himself.
    directorsNote: >
        "Soldier" was born from a need to examine how value systems travel
        through generations and how it can affect one's life as an adult. The
        story focuses on themes of shame, dysfunctional family, co-dependency
        and masculinity. Based on the research I've studied, mercenaries I've
        interviewed and my personal experiences, the idea of masculinity seems
        to be universally linked to a concept of toughness. To suppress emotions
        is considered as a virtue and strength. Expressing emotions, besides
        anger, is a sign of weakness. This one-dimensioned narration overshadows
        essential sides of humanity such as empathy, caring, vulnerability and
        feeling of belonging. There are no stereotypical good or bad characters
        in the film - only people who try to do their best with the skill set
        they have in given circumstances. Through this polyphonic voice, I wish
        to provide a frame for the audience to reflect their own values and
        behavioural patterns.

        Brother and Sister. Twins.

        He: a man who has never uttered a word since they managed to escape the
        war. His only way of communicating is through dance.

        She: a woman who can’t stop using her fists instead of her words. She
        takes care of them both. Her only way of communicating is through
        violence. 

        Despite being homeless, they aim for another life. Poverty is what
        stands between them and a chance for a brighter future. Their
        desperation for something as simple as new shoes and a roof over their
        heads lead them into the criminal “Import-Export” industry. Things take
        a radical turn when the merchandise they’re supposed to transport turns
        up in the form of two young girls. They are now forced to make a
        decision: do they become the people they used to fear? Or do they return
        to the streets where they might end up having to sell themselves in
        order to survive?

        We follow the Twins during two intense days where all our notions of
        self-evident morality are turned upside down.
    directorsNote: >
        DOGBORN is a drama thriller that gets right under your skin. My goal
        here is to create a powerful visual experience that shakes and moves the
        audience. I also aim to create one hell of a cinematic ride that keeps
        you on the edge of your seat.


        The TWINS officially don’t exist on the legal and social map of society.
        They lack worth, identities and a safety net. They’re part of a cogwheel
        consisting of buyers, sellers and merchandise. It is not their fate to
        act as buyers. The only options are to sell or be sold. Anything to
        survive.



        This setup is obviously brutal. Therefore we need to establish the raw
        humanity of the TWINS so we always remember why they’re making choices
        we might instinctively react to with disgust. If our confrontation with
        their pain and desperation feels authentic, we will understand their
        actions and what they’re fighting for. 


        In all honesty, we don’t know how we would act in the same nightmare of
        a situation.

    synopsis: >-
        Carol of the Bells is a story about three families – Ukrainian, Polish,
        and Jewish – and how they lived in the same house in the city of
        Stanislaviv in 1938-1944. When the Soviets and Nazis occupied the city
        the Jews and Poles were banished or executed. The Ukrainian music
        teacher managed to save her neighbours’ children and her own daughter at
        the expense of her life. The story is told through the memories of
        Teresa, a famous New York singer who once was the Polish girl saved by
        the music teacher. She recalls these events on Christmas night while
        waiting for the flight of Yaroslava – the Ukrainian girl with whom they
        survived the war together. The only thing that Teresa has from those
        days is the Ukrainian song – Shchedryk (the original song that Carol of
        the Bells is based on). Now, she dreams of singing it together with
        Yaroslava.

    synopsis: >
        The event organiser, Philip, goes to Berlin with his best friend right
        after his father dies. At night, in the city where he last lived with
        his father as a child, the two of them find themselves in the flat of
        their friend Anna, who has been living in Germany with her husband for
        15 years. All night they discuss, fight and reconcile, learning new and
        sometimes scary details of their friends and about their own lives. They
        raise the kind of questions that occur to all modern people at some
        point and discuss some of the more painful topics in the history of
        Germany, the USSR, and modern Russia. Faced with the knowledge that he
        needs to grow up very quickly, Philip tries to understand who he is,
        what his place is in the world, how he should navigate in this new
        reality, and formulate new principles for his life.

    synopsis: >-
        Raffy’s son Donut is dying and his final wish is to be a ninja just like
        his favourite show, Space Ninja Maxx. He flies Donut to Japan where he
        makes a deal with Takeshi, a ninja master. Takeshi trains Donut
        physically and mentally to be a ninja while Raffy learns to cook
        Japanese beef bowls working in Takeshi’s restaurant. Donut tries to
        perfect the vanishing technique of Super Ninja Maxx but fails.

        Takeshi’s final lesson: Ninjas work in the shadows and do their mission
        with precision, never fearing death. This speech echoes throughout
        scenes of Donut

        prepping for his scheduled surgery. Time passes. Raffy has perfected a
        recipe in his own restaurant. Behind him is Donut dressed as a Ninja.
        Donut tells him that he has perfected the vanishing technique. Donut
        asks him to close his eyes and promises that this time, it’ll work.
        Raffy enters zen mode as he hears the sounds of waterfalls.

        When he opens his eyes, Donut is gone. His son has finally become the
        Ninja he always wanted.
    directorsNote: >
        I grew up without seeing much of my father because he worked abroad to
        support our family. I was forced to grow up when my mom had cancer. I
        became the man of the house while I struggled with college. I blamed my
        father for everything wrong with my life. Looking back, I now have a
        better understanding of his sacrifices. Instead of being home with us,
        he worked odd jobs becoming a hero no one knew, working in the shadows
        without reward or recognition. Just like a ninja. In Ninja From Manila,
        a father makes his son’s wish come true: to be a ninja. He too learned
        to be a ninja, mentally readying himself for the biggest challenge in
        his life, the death of his son. The situation is absurd. The events are
        absurd. But at its core is a tragic yet heartfelt story. Quoting Taika
        Waititi: When the atmosphere seems tense and uncomfortable is the moment
        we feel the need to laugh most. The best comedy has tragedy behind it.
        It’s how I cope with tragedy and how my characters cope with theirs.

    synopsis: >-
        A devastating accident pushes the inhabitants of a small fishing village
        into a cascade of tragic consequences, unravelling episodically as focus
        skips between households and forays out across the lake. Magic, art and
        belief are fading in the community, as their connection to traditions is
        lost or harnessed for selfish purposes. We hear whispers of longings,
        exploring sexuality and playfulness across generations, but it is grief,
        ambition and fatalism that drive events to a final reckoning with nature
        itself. BIWA mirrors eight stories from the Japanese art tradition.
        Archetypes of our twelve characters unfold, as each view is interrupted,
        only to flow into the next, with characters fluidly exchanging places.
        Hanake, our teenage narrator, is present throughout. Her mindspace,
        shaped by children’s play but shifting toward adult needs, brings the
        archaic community into focus and casts it in conflict with modernity.
        Innocence is lost and much more is abandoned along with it.
    directorsNote: >-
        We need poetry to step out of the constraints of the dominant, pragmatic
        mindset and to describe the indescribable, in much the same way
        exploring a distant culture enables us to look at our own culture with
        fresh eyes. The traditional Japanese animistic Shinto belief system,
        upholding the spirituality of all living things, the soulfulness of the
        whole world, encompasses exactly what we here in the West have lost
        now. 

        Japanese culture as a whole exemplifies a certain type of organic and
        apolitical spirituality. The Eight Views is an Eastern artistic
        tradition that describes a place through eight poetic motives, such as
        evening glow, sails returning in the evening, autumn moon, temple bells,
        wild geese departing. Through these views, we’re seeking the
        intersection of this animistic sense of nature and the islets of magical
        thought at Estonia’s eastern borders. We aim to create expectations,
        deceive them, and distance the viewer from everyday realism.

    synopsis: >-
        Ona and Saule, two best friends, who work in a local canteen “Tasty”,
        enter a national competition which will challenge not only their cooking
        skills but their friendship as well.
    directorsNote: >
        In the culinary comedy “Tasty”, the most important theme is how value is
        created. That is, can raw simplicity, without packaging, be noticed in
        today’s world? Is value created only through image?


        The story takes place in a TV culinary contest full of exaggerated
        characters, who are all pretending to be who they are not. The two main
        female characters keep confronting each other during the competition,
        they have to find their value and to stop overestimating or
        underestimating themselves. Therefore, during the making of the film, my
        central focus will be an authentic, character-driven relationship
        between two characters. 



        The story takes place in the TV culinary contest. I would aim to break
        some of its spells, to show how its value is created. I would like to
        draw a clear contrast between the television world and reality.

    synopsis: >-
        A group of young people, fascinated by music, socially and nationally
        mixed up in a Kazakh neighbourhood against a back-drop of social turmoil
        and the drastically changing times of the early 90s in the Soviet Union.
        The main character of the story, an almost adult Kazakh boy, Bakha (16),
        falls in love with a Russian-Polish girl, Berta (18), who, feeling ready
        for a relationship of a different kind, is attracted to the frontman of
        the band from their courtyard – a Russian guy Vitka (19). And Vitka, in
        turn, does not miss a single pretty girl, while remaining officially a
        couple with Berta. And in this mess of a relationship, Bakha doesn’t
        seem to have any real force to fight. The age and the race abyss become
        an almost insurmountable obstacle for him, but, nevertheless, he ends up
        the winner. The life around these teenagers is pretty characteristic for
        the beginning of the 90’s: petty crime, theft and "gop-stop".
    directorsNote: >-
        This film is very important to me. I was born in Almaty. My story about
        teenagers intervenes with the beginning of the 90s: petty crime, theft
        and "gop-stop". The personal drama of the main character here is
        multi-layered: the gap between the participants of this trinity is not
        only in age, but also race. Separation, including social, which looms in
        the movie, is also present nowadays, mainly in small cities of Russia
        and Kazakhstan. This story of a teenager growing up takes place against
        the backdrop of a historical event. The event here is the death, in the
        summer of 1990, of Viktor Tsoi, the famous Russian Rock Singer. It is
        necessary to say a few words about Viktor Tsoi. Nowadays, young people
        are singing his songs on the streets of Almaty. He is a significant hero
        for a generation of today’s teenagers! A few weeks ago, people in
        Belurus marched in their thousands singing his song “We want Changes”
        and some of them were arrested for that (in 2020!)

    synopsis: >-
        Seven young people (16-18 years old) living in a metropolis, united by a
        common secret, begin a game where everyone has a role to play. In the
        world of play, in the middle of Taiga, in an ancient Scythian mound,
        there are mutants who have not been spared by an ecological disaster.
        Many years ago, they left the big world, seeing it as a danger to their
        children, who were growing up different from others. The children
        brought up in the mound have preserved the cultural traditions of their
        people, but they speak and think in many languages, understanding the
        diversity and richness of the world. Their lives remain closed to
        others.

        The overwhelming desire to be truly happy inspires Polina (17) to devise
        rules of the game and offer them to the others. It soon becomes clear
        that the game does not obey the rules, and fictional heroes are as
        unhappy as their creators. Events in the game offer the heroes a
        difficult and the only way to happiness – to overcome the silence they
        have been condemned to since their childhood and talk about the secret
        that unites their destinies.

    title_en: Hotel Intercontinental
    synopsis: "Welcome to the Hotel Intercontinental! We’re in 1970, Budapest, and nothing is what it seems. The hotel serves as a home for spies, counter-espionage, celebrities and small-time crooks. We see all this through the eyes of Ivan the green bellboy who has bigger plans that we would expect.\n\nThe officer of the internal counter intelligence, the crooked comrade Thoman wants to become the Manager of the hotel, a position filled by the counterspionage\_officer, the compliant communist\_Mrs Gyenes. As they both appreciate Ivan's excellent memory and observational skills, they both want to use him for their own goals.\n\nThe thing everyone in the hotel seem to have in common is opportunism. And Ivan is no different in the beginning, so he sees becoming an informant as an opportunity. Parallel to his growing love for the waitress, Ildi, he begins to see the true colors of the system. By the end he learns not to care only about himself as he turns on his control officer."

        Biniam (18) is a promising Eritrean cyclist who dreams of becoming an
        international pro. Experts grant him a great future in international
        cycling, but in general we don’t see too many riders of colour in our
        pro tours. Europe is not in a hurry to grant Eritreans a visa, fearing
        they will disappear as refugees. With the support of his family, friends
        and teammates, Biniam fights against the social, physical and
        administrative obstacles he encounters along the way. Over two years, we
        follow Biniam’s evolving performances during the big African tours where
        he catches the attention of major European teams, which eventually
        results in a European pro team. Will we soon see Biniam at the start of

        By investigating the disappearance of homeless people - journalist
        Madara, 28, solves her personal mission - to find her twin sister who

        Madara's bed.

    synopsis: >-
        People are disappearing without a trace. Journalist Madara, 28, is here
        to find out the truth. It's not only her job obligation but a personal
        interest as her twin sister is missing since childhood. Madara manages
        to establish trust between her and investigator Kovalski, 47, and is
        familiarized with a secret Interpol report of unexplained portals or
        black holes that are opening in various places and people disappear in
        them.

        A black hole unfolds under Madara's bed and she falls into a world that
        at a first glance resembles the early Middle Ages. She finds the way
        back but Kovalskis persuades her not to tell anyone as she might become
        a laboratory rat for deep state powers who are behind the chaox taking
        over the world in order to establish a new world order.

        Kovalskis and Madara start to explore the parallel world and come across
        other “travelers” - homeless thieves Zhorik and Shtanga, a gray haired
        lawyer Bernhard and a quarrelling couple - January and his wife Ponchik.

    titleOriginal: Class A
    budget: 1800000

    lookingFor: 'Co-producers, Sales Agent'
    synopsis: >-
        CLASS A follows 11-year-old BOBBY O’BRIEN, a precocious and energetic
        boy obsessed with becoming a great detective. Set against the backdrop
        of 1980’s, working class, inner-city Dublin, BOBBY and his pal NELL
        torment their family, friends and neighbours as they set up their own
        private investigation enterprise. When BOBBY’S brother OISIN disappears
        this story of innocence and adventure must challenge the murky world of
        criminality and addiction. BOBBY, with the help of NELL, apply their
        detective skills to finding OISIN. They set out on an mission across the
        iconic city of Dublin, that will ultimately change how they view their
        world forever.
    directorsNote: >-
        The characters in Class A are so well drawn and charming that the
        audience will be unable to avoid falling in love with them. It’s a
        snapshot of Dublin at a time when the economy was depressed, the youth
        were rebelling and the streets were awash with drugs. This tough and
        often daunting place is seen through the lens of an 11-year-old boy
        whose vivid imagination, innocence and love of Kojak wins us over from
        the start.



        There are so many wonderful roles for actors here. Bobby’s mother Maura
        is at the heart of the story. A strong character who will ultimately be
        the one to stand up against the pushers. Her relationship with Bobby is
        deeply touching. Also, his best friend Nell has the potential to be one
        of cinema’s great “characters”!

        Visually, the idea of bringing 1980’s Dublin to the screen is so
        exciting. The hairstyles, the clothing, the cars, all must be carefully
        executed. Photographically, this film will marry urban grit with
        cinematic beauty. A portrait of a time & a community.

    title_en: The Man Who Desalinated the Sea
    logline: >-
        Due to his unique claimed ability to see in the dark (not yet proven), a
        coast guard from Lithuania accidentally encounters a savage “Robinson”
        figure in the dunes on a neutral strip of land, the Curonian Spit –
        right between the Russian and Lithuanian border.

    synopsis: >
        When a coast guard from Lithuania accidentally encounters a savage
        “Robinson” figure in the dunes on a neutral strip of land named the
        Curonian Spit – between the Russian and Lithuanian border - speculations
        arise. The man, Timur, states that he is a Georgian native, who started
        living as a hermit back in the middle of the 20th century. Timur, who
        looks no older than 40, states that he was born in 1928 and arrived at
        the Spit right after the end of WWII.

        What do radical Zionists, Ukrainian nationalists, French
        revolutionaries, Polish communists, Soviet spies and Aristotle Onassis
        have in common? All of them wanted Jan Gerhard dead.


        1971/08/20. Jan Gerhard, a politician, soldier, writer and celebrity of
        his time, is murdered in Warsaw. The case is investigated by the best
        men from all existing law enforcement entities, including Anna (30), an
        ambitious forensic scientist, and Henryk (44), a Civic Militia
        investigator struggling with war trauma.


        Within the season Anna and Henryk run the case, checking all the
        suspects: from Gerhard’s numerous lovers to his political enemies. Most
        of the suspects and crucial witnesses disappear or commit suicide in
        mysterious circumstances. Finally, the investigators find a new lead –
        Red Orchestra, a soviet top-secret espionage network operating in the
        whole Europe. From this moment, the lives of Anna, Henryk and their
        families are in danger. The situation becomes even more tense when the
        killer is found! Gerhard’s future son-in-law is sentenced to death just
        as Anna and Henryk… find the real killer.

    synopsis: >-
        “When you fall” is teen drama series, set up in a big city, present
        time, when being a teenager is more difficult than traveling into Space.
        Or at least this is how our protagonists feel like. It’s a story about
        seven very different teenagers troubled by different problems that learn
        to accept each other and become friends. But, the newly- formed crew
        that values open-mindedness and acceptance of differences, clashes with
        misjudgments and prejudices of others: at school, at home, at their
        neighborhoods and communities…

        Each episode faces the crew with even bigger and harder challenges,
        learning that even failure can be a valuable experience. In the final
        two episodes of the show, a tragic event changes them forever – for
        better or for worse – who knows… since the show ends with a cliffhanger.

    synopsis: >
        Hans is a failed writer, 53 years old, on the verge of suicide, who has
        given up on writing and, after a series of interviews, finds a job in an
        insurance agency and also helps part-time a friend for social services.
        One day, while sorting through the things of his recently deceased
        mother, he discovers he is a distant descendent of Hans Christian
        Andersen. From that day forward his assiduous reading and constant
        research revive in him his lost imagination and the possibility of
        returning to his writings. Life begins to present him with real people
        who strangely seem to have stepped out of the pages of his
        great-grandfather and who, even more than before, claim their right to
        life. A refugee called Sirenetto/Merman, a little girl from the Roma
        community who sells drugs and matches, a legless soldier recently
        returned from Syria, a Trans-gender friend, a dancer from the TV who
        wears red shoes and wants to be famous, a young extremist from the Black
        Bloc...From each encounter, some violent, some not, but all
        challengingly difficult, at one point Hans begins to think they are
        figments of his imagination but each one opens his eyes to a different
        reality and enables him to go ahead with his ‘rebirth’ as a man and as a
        writer. The stories and the characters merge and when, eventually, Hans
        gets over his personal crisis he believes he is unable to find any of
        them. It is as if they have returned to the pages of Andersen’s stories
        or to the new ones that Hans has written. But life will respond
        differently.

    synopsis: >-
        Siberia, 19th century. The young bishop Amvrosy travels north to visit
        his new Orthodox flock of native inhabitants. On the journey he is
        accompanied by an old monk, Kiriyak, who knows the local language and
        customs and doesn’t approve of the thoughtless mass baptism of
        indigenous people.

        On the way they are overtaken by a snowstorm and bishop Amvrosy is left
        alone with his guide without any food and transport. There is only one
        pair of skis and the guide leaves the bishop promising to return. The
        bishop is sure that the guide is deceiving him because he is a savage
        who refuses to accept Orthodoxy.
    directorsNote: >-
        I read this story by Leskov for a long time. Although I was born and
        raised in Soviet times, a time of the denial of God, I have always been
        interested in the topic of religious beliefs. My diploma work at Film
        School was based on the play by Semyon Ermolaev "The God". Today the
        attitude towards faith has changed in society. I think there is much
        interest in religious topics and it is increasing. I am concerned about
        many questions, in particular, why the Yakuts closely adopted Orthodoxy,
        while remaining also faithful to their own faith, to Yryng Aiyy Toyon
        Tangara (the Supreme Deity Үrүng Aiyy). It seems to me that among a
        significant part of our population, the image of Aiyy has merged with
        the idea of a Christian God. And yet most of the Yakuts remain still
        pagans and faith in Aiyy is in each of us. Through my project, I would
        like to show the pagan consciousness, the pagan worldview of my people
        who were not influenced (or influenced?) by Christianity.

    title_en: Hugo & Co
    budget: 1480000
    synopsis: "Welcome to a forgotten corner of Bohemia. Poverty is rife and local inhabitants often struggle with debt and property seizures. Enter Hugo & Co, a law firm intent on championing those robbed or cheated by loan sharks and financial predators.\nFallen aristocrat Hugo – a brilliant legal mind, but flawed genius with an impenetrable moral code – is released from jail. Unable to practise in court, he hires Žofie, a sharp, idealistic –\_and pregnant – young lawyer. Her alluring empathy and idealism set the stage for a struggle with the diffident Hugo. A reluctant Robin Hood, misanthropic Hugo says his business is “not a bleeding-heart charity”. But, as they win one case after another, Hugo and Žofie come to realise that the curtain is about to rise on the identity of the puppet master behind the financial machinations, and he is closer than they could ever imagine.\nEach episode is built around a classic legal procedural drama, in which Hugo and Žofie unravel an individual case, often inspired by true events that resonate with a Czech and international audience. Characters include an intrepid reporter and the estranged son of the puppet master, supporting the larger story throughout the series as our main characters’ fight with the local oligarch reaches its climax."

    title_en: The Red Princess
    budget: 9000000
    synopsis: >-
        Austria, the end of the 19th century. The eccentric young Habsburg
        Archduchess Erzsi is a fixture of the most influential salons of
        Vienna’s rich cultural life. But when the "Mayerling incident” scandal
        hits her and she discovers that her beloved grandfather, Emperor Franz
        Joseph I, may be responsible for the tragic death of her own deeply
        missed father, crown prince Rudolf. As shocked as the rest of her
        generation, Erzsi loses faith in her grandfather. She revolts and takes
        her rebellion a step further than her famous grandmother, Empress Sissi,
        notorious for her solitary travels, poetry, starvation, and tenacious
        quest for eternal youth and beauty. Erzsi violates imperial custom by
        refusing to marry Archduke Franz Ferdinand and forces the Emperor to
        allow her a morganatic marriage, thus contributing significantly to the
        Monarchy's disintegration. After WWI, a devastated Vienna is plagued by
        hunger, typhoid, and the Great Flu epidemic. Archduke Franz Ferdinand
        and the emperor have died, and with them the Monarchy. Erzsi, however,
        does not mourn. She and her new lover see a chance for rebirth, a bright
        future amidst the ruins: Socialism. At Vienna's May Day procession, a
        resilient Erszi throws red carnations from a limousine and becomes “the
        Red Princess.” But Erszi is too much of a royal to represent the
        people’s cause, and too much of an “idealist punk” to be accepted by the
        new aristocracy. And while she dreams of a "Red Vienna,” Erzsi must face
        the fall of her beloved city as a new leader rises - Adolf Hitler.

        industry, through discussions with four-time Oscar nominee Danny Elfman,

        by connecting them to key international film professionals such as
        casting directors, casting agents, producers and the press. In addition,
        the talents can acquire various practical skills needed in their future
        international careers.

        POWR Baltic Stories Exchange is aimed to give mainly **Nordic and Baltic
        scriptwriters access to an informal and international forum where they
        can present their projects and writing talent** during the largest
        regional film market in North-Eastern Europe.  In 2020 the programme
        will also host a project as part of Russia in Focus. POWR is a great
        opportunity for producers to connect with a project at an early stage or
        to find a writer, co-writer, director, or script consultant for your own
        project.

    contents_en: "TV Beats Forum, a part of [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://poff.ee/) is the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event conference. The forum reacts to the real demand of the industry as a drama series’ market takes over and the need, for content by global streaming platforms increases. Local stories can travel universally as language barriers are no longer a problem and authenticity rules over generic and universal.\n\nTV Beats Forum is the place to meet the key international players in the region. Starting from small steps from 2018, with a one-day programme, we have an aim to build a drama series co-production market in the coming years. The forum’s prime objective is to inspire and facilitate the entry of regional producers and service providers into the international series co-production industry. With this in mind, TV Beats Forum explores global success stories from multinational productions. Scriptwriters, directors, composers, producers will share their experience as well as tips and tricks for creating a successful drama series. During the event, participants get a comprehensive overview of industry trends and are invited to attend a range of masterclasses. The organisers also make the best of local original formats available by presenting a catalogue of the most successful works.\n\n\n#### 2020 Programme\n\n**Thursday 26 November**\n\n10:00 (EET) **Welcoming words** by Wendy Mitchell, Marge Liiske and Jevgeni Supin\n\n10:05 – 10:25 **How Has COVID Impacted Global Production?**\n\nHow Has COVID Impacted Global Production? // Leading analytics company Ampere Analysis shares new research about how the pandemic has influenced film and TV shoots in Europe and beyond in 2020, and what the forecast is for 2021. *Guy Bisson, Research Director, Ampere Analysis*\n\n10:30 – 11:15 **New Solutions: Producing and Co-Producing in the COVID Era**\n\nProducers from across Europe discuss how they have had to adapt their productions to meet pandemic safety measures, as well as how they have found new solutions to financing and co-producing in 2020 and beyond.

        Black Nights Stars, a program designed to support 6 selected young
        actors from the Baltic Sea region to promote their talent outside their
        home territory, will also offer a range of public workshops and events
        to other professional actors, producers and directors.
    contents_en: >-
        Claudia Landsberger, Head of Black Nights Stars Programme states that,
        as the new challenges in the film industry also have a significant
        impact on actors and casting crew, “Casting a talent to film has also
        moved online and actors now have to develop a whole new set of skills to
        present themselves in that world. It’s a new challenge, but
        online-casting is also a phenomenal opportunity for talents from
        different, underexposed regions to stand out.” 


        The programme of Black Nights Stars will focus on how to navigate a
        career in an online world. “As always, we invite acting professionals
        from the region to meet international casting experts and to participate
        at various panels and masterclasses. For accredited professionals we
        will introduce three topics – what casting directors can do for your
        project, securing cast and how to get the right actors for your
        project,” she adds.

        ###### Claudia Landsberger, Head of Black Nights Stars Programme

        of esteemed casting directors and industry professionals, who will also
        conduct workshops, masterclasses and one to one meeting with the talents
        for relevant guidance. “There’s a huge, untapped resource of young
        talent in the region, so even our very experienced jury will have a
        tough time choosing. The Black Nights Stars 2020 will be announced
        shortly,” Landsberger says.

        16 projects will be presented in the official selection of the
        Co-Production Market taking place on November 27-30, 2018, at
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event during Tallinn Black Nights Film
        Festival. The market’s 17th edition contains stories of both personal
        and political repression, touches on mental health issues, and features
        a number of films about female connection.
    contents_en: >
        **Leana Jalukse, Co-Production Market Manager:**


        “As always, we welcome both established filmmakers as well as promising
        debutants, and we are delighted to have earned the trust of a string of
        very experienced producers. It was a challenge making a selection from
        all the high-quality submissions.”


        Estonian ***After Hours***, a multiplot following a life-changing night
        of three sisters, is the second collaboration by director Priit Pääsuke
        and producer Marianne Ostrat, whose former projects have screened at
        Venice, San Sebastian, and Karlovy Vary. Another female-centric film
        comes from our Focus Country Italy, with ***Cartacrespa*** by debut
        director Michele Codarin telling a tale of friendship between two women
        from vastly different backgrounds. ***Chemistry*** by debut director
        Adina Dulcu, backed by established producer Tudor Giurgiu, Libra Film
        Productions, Romania, continues on the theme, portraying the story of a
        woman whose individual fight evolves into an ideological one in a deeply
        polarised environment.


        Women are also the main characters in two films exploring the teenage
        years – French-Finnish ***A Girl’s Room*** by Aino Suni is a thriller
        about love and manipulation, while Finnish Inari Niemi’s Light ***Light
        Light Light*** sees a woman on a journey to her adolescence – the
        summer, which ended in the suicide of her lesbian lover. LGBTQ vs
        ideology continue to be the main themes in ***Youri*** by Sander Burger,
        the Netherlands, which follows a talented Russian pianist emigrating
        from the Soviet Union in fear of certain persecution. Similarly,
        Hungarian ***Erasing Frank*** by debut director Gabor Fabricius portrays
        a talented musician, whose career is destroyed and who is driven to
        fight his war for freedom from a psychiatric ward in the 1980s. Another
        artist in peril is ***Comrade Dona***, a Romanian sculptor abducted
        during a stop-over in North Korea, in the film by director Igor
        Cobileanski and producer Iuliana Tarnovetchi, whose previous
        collaboration *Eastern Business* was presented at BE 2012 and brought
        home two awards from the official competition of Tallinn Black Nights
        Film Festival in 2016.


        Politics and mental issues continue to play a role in Kristina Grozeva
        and Petar Valchanov’s ***Triumph***, the third part of a trilogy based
        on true events. Icelandic ***Quake*** by yet another debut director
        Tinna Hrafnsdóttir tells a harrowing tale of a mother concealing her
        memory loss in order to keep the custody of her son – as a first, the
        project was also selected to compete in Script Pool Tallinn this year.
        ***Oxygen*** by Ernestas Jankauskas from Lithuania portrays a woman
        suffering from anxiety disorder, another issue of critical importance to
        communicate to the audiences. And Polish ***Patagonia*** by debut
        director Aga Zwiefka, who has won a string of awards for her
        documentaries, features a dystopian world, in which suicide is a crime.


        More stories of individuals crushed by the system come from Ukraine,
        with ***Zenith*** by Igor Stekolenko being a psychological thriller
        about a talented surgeon losing his career after a wrongful accusation,
        and Finland, with ***The Oasis of Now*** by debut director Hamy Ramezan,
        who has won a string of awards for his short films, and Jussi Rantamäki,
        who produced Cannes award winner *The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli
        Mäki*, telling a story about a family of refugees about to be deported.
        An equally poetic story of migration is ***Wedding on My Street***, a
        feature film debut by Shota Gamisonia, Georgia, and the theme of broken
        families is continued in Latvian ***Lovable*** by director Stanislavs
        Tokalovs and successful producer tandem Alise Gelze and Aija Berzina.


        A **Eurimages Co-Production Development Award** worth 20 000 Euro will
        be handed out by a jury consisting ofEmma Scott, Production and
        Distribution Manager, Screen Ireland, Ireland; Jeremy Zelnik, Head of
        Industry, Les Arcs Film Festival, France; Giovanni Pompili, Producer,
        Kino Produzioni, Italy.


        In addition, one project will receive the **Screen International Best
        Pitch Award**, offering coverage of the life-cycle of the winning film,
        and two producers will receive the **Cannes Marché du Film Producers’
        Network Award** for Promising Young Producer with free accreditations to
        next year’s edition.

        (Russia). 


        The young actors have been chosen to present their emerging talent based
        on their first feature film and TV roles. Participating in Black Nights
        Stars will give the actors a chance to meet with film professionals and
        to showcase their talent. They will also participate in various
        masterclasses, workshops and industry networking events.


        According to the **member of the international jury, Lina Todd from Lina
        Todd casting agency**, it was a tremendously gratifying experience to
        select talent from the Baltics. “Though all unique, they share an
        amazing presence, an unexpected force, mystery, soulful beauty, fierce
        intensity, intricate sensuality, and deepness which feels unique to
        their countries and still universal in their sincerity. It is of great
        value to the film industry to discover these marvellous and fresh
        artists who will shine, not just in their country, but internationally.
        To bring them to the film industry’s attention so they can further
        enrich our experience as audiences and bring us closer together is a
        treasure,” she added. 


        The 2020 selection jury included **Lina Todd**, a casting director from
        New York (*Little Man Tate, A Good Day to Die Hard, Crazy Alien*);
        **Mike Rosser** (*Screen International*), former European Shooting Star
        and 2018 Black Nights Star **Pääru Oja** (*O2, The Last Ones*); US born
        casting director **Nancy Bishop**, based in Europe (*The Liberator, the
        Romanoffs, Whiskey Cavalier*) and **Magdalena Szwarcbart**, casting
        director from Poland (*Schindler’s List, Cold War, Gareth Jones*). 


        The programme of Black Nights Stars 2020 will be carried out as an
        online event at [Industry@Tallinn & Baltic
        Event](https://industry.poff.ee/) taking place during 23-27 November.
        The Black Nights Stars programme is presented by the Industry@Tallinn &

        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, the industry strand affiliated to
        Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival has decided to move online completely
        due to likely travel restrictions caused by the resurgence of COVID-19.
    contents_en: >-
        The preparations for the 24th edition of the Tallinn Black Nights Film
        Festival include the readiness to provide global industry and press
        access for the films and events, while preparations for holding a
        physical event are still underway.


        Following the first signs of the possible resurgence of COVID-19 in the
        country, the organisers of the festival and its affiliated industry
        event have followed the predictions of the Health Board of Estonia and
        made the decision to move the industry programs online, while continuing
        to accept project submissions. The global film industry representatives
        will still be able to apply for access to all events, project pitches
        and films regardless of their geographical location.


        Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented:
        „Following the discussions with Estonia’s health officials, it seems
        more than likely that there will be another outbreak in one form or
        another and that foreign travel will either be blocked or with
        restrictions. This would not enable for our guests to attend the events
        properly and thus, with a heavy heart, we have decided from early on to
        not to take any risks and move all our activities online this year.”


        “Having said that, I believe that moving online also presents us with
        some new opportunities and also for the audience – we hope that even
        more film industry professionals than before are able to benefit from
        our program, as they do not have to travel to Tallinn to attend the
        events and they can access the content from anywhere at their best
        convenience. Also, while preparing the programme we can play around with
        different engaging digital formats and involve speakers, who would not
        be able to visit us in Tallinn,” Liiske added.


        The team is currently busy working on the programme and the first
        speakers will be announced in September. The programme will include
        seminars, workshops, masterclasses, panel discussions, as usual,
        covering the most burning topics of film and TV market as well as PÖFF
        Academy events directed towards actors, scouting agents, film music
        composers, costume designers and set photographers. 


        Currently, [submissions](https://industry.poff.ee/project-entry/) are
        open for [Baltic Event Co-production
        Market](https://industry.poff.ee/co-production-market/) (projects
        seeking co-producers, financiers and sales agents), [Script Pool
        Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/script-pool-tallinn/) (film and series
        scripts worldwide competition) and [POWR Baltic Stories
        Exchange](https://industry.poff.ee/powr-baltic-stories-exchange-2-2/)
        (Nordic and Baltic scriptwriters seeking producers). The deadline for
        submitting the projects is September, 25 and the evaluation of the
        projects is carried out online. Everyone who has submitted the project
        has access to Industry @Tallinn & Baltic event online-program including
        workshops, masterclasses, panel discussions, meetings with industry
        professionals, etc. 


        The programme will be announced in various stages throughout September
        and October.


        Black Nights Film Festival is making preparations for several scenarios.


        Since the first COVID-19-related lockdown in spring, Black Nights has
        been preparing for several possible scenarios, getting ready to take
        place physically while also upgrading the digital infrastructure that
        would enable to organise a hybrid or even a completely digital event. It
        looks likely that foreign travel to Estonia will be restricted, thus
        accredited foreign press and industry delegates will be granted access
        to the festival’s programme digitally via the Shift72 platform, no
        matter their geographic location. Travel of foreign filmmakers and the
        press will be decided upon according to the situation in October and
        November, depending on whether Estonia’s COVID restrictions allow
        movement from the country of their current residency or not.


        The physical screenings, however, have not been cancelled, as the Health
        Board of Estonia currently remains optimistic that the complete lockdown
        of cinemas can be avoided this time around. As the festival has always
        hosted several hundred filmmakers to present their films every year,
        some might be forced to do so virtually this year. For this reason, the
        festival is preparing virtual video greeting and Q&A formats that would
        precede the film screenings. There is also a high probability that the
        festival will cut back on the size of its programme this year.


        Tiina Lokk, the director and head of the programme of Black Nights
        commented: “Our off-season side events, the Haapsalu Horror Film
        Festival we organised completely online during the lockdown this spring,
        and the Tartu Love Film Festival which is currently taking place as a
        hybrid event, have provided us with the valuable experience of
        organising virtual screenings and Q&As and combining them with a
        physical event. We are doing everything in our power to hold physical
        screenings and bring over as many foreign guests as possible, but the
        virus and Estonia’s Health Board will have the final say in these
        matters.” 


        The festival’s plans for digital development goes further than this
        though, including plans to build, over the course of the next couple of
        years, a unique online environment that caters the festival’s needs in
        terms of organising public and closed screenings, conferences and an
        extensive online industry platform that includes a market place, virtual
        meeting and pitching rooms and a year-around project market to connect
        projects at all stages of their cycle with respective parties of
        interest – financiers, producers, distributors etc.


        Another important aspect will be the year-around promotion of Estonia as
        a location for production and recruiting talent, including the
        introduction of locations of interest, a database of the country’s
        professionals, exhibiting the services they provide and the content they
        have produced. Estonia’s first two regional film funds – the Viru Film
        Fund and the Tartu Film Fund – will be in charge of keeping the
        locations and talent pools up to date.


        The third fundamental element of the new platform is education, that
        will see the launch of PÖFF Academy aiming to provide high-quality
        audiovisual education with partners at the Estonian Film Institute, the
        Baltic Film, Media, Art and Communication School and the Pallas
        University of Applied Sciences. This will be based on the structure that
        has been laid out by the Creative Gate project, organised by the
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event team, that has been holding events
        directed towards actors, scouting agents, film music composers, costume
        designers and set photographers over the last three years, and which
        added the European Film Academy Masterclasses into the mix last year.


        Festival director Tiina Lokk commented:  „Some of the changes that are
        being prepared will actually rewire the festival’s DNA, making it more
        digital, networked, ubiquitous and inclusive than ever before! But first
        and foremost, we are hoping to make the physical festival still happen
        this year!” she added.

        Ivan I. Tverdovskiy’s Conference, Baltic Event  Co-Production Market
        2019 project, screens in the Giornate Degli Autori competition, an
        independent sidebar Venice Film Festival!
    contents_en: >-
        [The Conference](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11258824/) is the fourth
        feature of Russian director Ivan I. Tverdovskiy. Previous films of the
        31-year old director have been the festival hits Corrections Class,
        Zoologia, and Jumpman.


        According to the website of Giornate degli Autori the line up for this
        year’s takes us through an amazing journey through space and time. It
        starts in rural China in the 1990s (***Mama***, a sober and remarkably
        mature debut by Chinese filmmaker **Li Dongmei**), leaps to Palestine
        (***200 Meters***, an Italian-Palestinian co-production directed by
        **Ameen Nayfeh** and starring **Ali Suliman**, one of the top Arab
        actors today), then arrives to Eastern Europe.


        Giornate’s lineup takes you from Russia’s Far North, a Siberia
        ambivalent about the consumer culture (***The Whaler Boy*** by newcomer
        **Philipp Yurye** and co-produced by the late **Marion Hänsel**), then
        to Moscow, with its political secrets and moral dilemmas
        (***Conference***) and on to Hungary and impossible love affairs
        (***Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time***, by
        **Lili Horvát**) and to Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina –
        all in the same film – ***Oasis*** by Serbian filmmaker **Ivan Ikić**.


        Italy is obviously on the itinerary: specifically Puglia, with
        ***Stonebreaker ***by the **De Serio** brothers. France and Algerian
        roots appear in ***Honey Cigar*** (debut by **Kamir Aïnouz**). Giornate
        also crosses the Atlantic and washes up in Canada (***Saint-Narcisse***
        by **Bruce LaBruce**) and the United States (***Residue***, a stirring
        debut by **Merawi Gerima**). Lastly, Giornate drops down to Santiago de
        Chile, setting off a queer love story at the time of the Pinochet regime
        (***Tengo miedo torero*** by **Rodrigo Sepúlveda**).


        [Giornate degli
        Autori](http://www.giornatedegliautori.com/index.asp?lang=eng) was born
        in 2004, as an independent sidebar of the Venice Film Festival. The aim
        of the event is to draw attention to high-quality cinema, without any
        kind of restriction, with special care for innovation, research,
        originality and independence. These are all features of the 12 films
        selected as well as being reflected in the special events held during
        the Days in the **Villa** degli Autori.

        This year’s Music Meets Film held virtually along with the complete
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event programme, will give an insight into the
        creative layers of composers, film directors and industry leaders. One
        of the main speakers of the programme is four-time Oscar nominee Danny
        Elfman, who has established himself as one of the most versatile and
        accomplished film composers in the industry. 
    contents_en: >-
        The conversation panel named “Choosing Doors: A Conversation with Danny
        Elfman” will discuss the paths Elfman has chosen in his creative life.
        After the initial conversation, participants will have the possibility
        to ask questions online from the composer directly.* The panel will be
        hosted by Marko Ahtisaari, Artistic Director of Helsinki Festival,
        designer entrepreneur and one half of the band Construction.  


        For over 30 years, **Danny Elfman** has established himself as one of
        the sought-after and acclaimed film composers in the world. A native of
        Los Angeles, Elfman grew up loving film music. He travelled the world as
        a young man, absorbing its musical diversity. He helped found the band
        Oingo Boingo, and came to the attention of a young Tim Burton, who asked
        him to write the score for *Pee-wee´s Big Adventure*. 34 years later,
        the two have forged one of the most fruitful composer-director
        collaborations in film history. In addition to his film work, Elfman
        wrote the iconic theme music for the television series *The Simpsons*
        and *Desperate Housewives*. 


        During his long career, Elfman has collaborated with directors including
        Tim Burton, Gus Van Sant, Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, Rob
        Minkoff, Guillermo del Toro, Brian De Palma, James Ponsoldt and David O´
        Russell. Beginning with his first score on Tim Burton´s *Pee-wee´s Big
        Adventure*, Elfman has scored over 100 films, including *Milk*
        (Oscar-nominated), *Good Will Hunting* (Oscar-nominated), *Big Fish*
        (Oscar-nominated), *Men in Black* (Oscar-nominated), *Edward
        Scissorhands*, *Batman*, *To Die For*, *The Nightmare Before Christmas*,
        *Alice in Wonderland*, *Silver Linings Playbook*, American Hustle*,
        *Justice League*, *Spiderman*, *A Simple Plan*, *Midnight Run*,
        *Sommersby*, *Dolores Claiborne*, and the Errol Morris documentaries
        *The Unknown Known* and *Standard Operating Procedure*. Most recently he
        has provided music for Tim Burton film *Dumbo* for Disney, and *The
        Grinch* for Universal, and is currently working on the upcoming film
        *The Voyage of Dr Doolittle* (2020), starring Robert Downey Jr. 


        The programme of Music Meets Film, taking place for the 9th time in
        2020, is primarily intended for composers and musicians aiming to create
        music for film and takes a look into what makes a film composer tick and

        Black Nights Stars, the initiative of the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic
        Event, announces six young actors from the Baltic Sea region to
        participate in the programme this November.
    contents_en: >+
        The Black Nights Stars programme is designed to build a bridge between
        foreign casting directors and new talent from the region – enhancing
        their international visibility. The aim is to help young actors from the
        Baltic Sea region to promote themselves outside their home territory and
        acquire the practical skills needed for their future international
        careers.


        The international jury selected six young actors from over 30
        candidates, who are invited to attend the Black Nights Stars
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, a part of the 23rd edition of the
        **Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival** (PÖFF):


        **Magdalena Berus** (Poland)


        **Maria Dragus** (Germany)


        **Mimosa Willamo** (Finland)


        **Povilas Jatkevičius**  (Lithuania)


        **Risto Vaidla** (Estonia)


        **Franz Malmsten** (Estonia)


        The young actors have been chosen to present their emerging talent from
        their first feature films and TV roles. Participating in Black Nights
        Stars will give these actors a chance to meet with film professionals
        and showcase their talent as well as get connected with international
        film professionals and gain some of the practical skills needed for
        their future international careers. During the program, they will
        participate in masterclasses, workshops and industry networking events.


        This year’s international 2019 selection jury included Nikki Baughan
        (Screen International), Estonian Director of Photography Elen Lotman
        (*When You Least Expect; Demons*), former European Shooting Star and
        2019 winner of the Bruno O’Ya Best Young Estonian Actor Award Rea Lest
        (Shooting Star 2019; *November*; *Scandinavian Silence*), UK and USA
        based casting director Jeremy Zimmerman (*Moon, Hellboy, Willow, Keeping
        Mum*) and Claudia Landsberger (creative producer).


        ”I think last year’s Black Nights Stars programme was a great success
        with interesting events, panels and workshops, great people and great
        new contacts,” says Raakel Huikuri, Talent Agent from Lisa Richards
        Nordic. “We were introduced to brilliant new talent, and ended up
        signing a new client through the event.”


        The Black Nights Stars program takes place from 25-27 November 2019. The
        Black Nights Stars programme is presented by the Industry@Tallinn &
        Baltic Event during the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and the
        European Regional Development Fund funded project Creative Gate.

        The events in the world have taken the course of an apocalyptic script.
        What will the future bring to the genre film production is not clear,
        but we hope that the situation does not stop you creating and developing
        the ideas and that the halt of the film industry is temporary. The
        moment is right to imagine what kind of stories would happen in this new
        world. Eager to find out about your latest film ideas, European Genre
        Forum (EGF) has decided to postpone the deadline for submitting your
        projects to the beginning of May! So take your chance and send in your
        film idea! 


        At the moment we can’t say for sure that EGF 2020 will take place in
        full capacity, but we want to give it a try. Hence, EGF finds best to
        follow the situation, continue with the project selection and extend the
        deadline of project submission to May 4th.  Thanks to all of you who
        have sent yours already!


        The European Genre Forum (EGF), taking place for 6th year in 2020, is a
        training programme aimed at European directors developing their 1st or
        2nd feature-length genre film project with an established producer
        attached. The programme sets to boost the careers of future European
        players in the genre film industry through two talent labs, packed with
        trainings, panels mentoring and pitching sessions. *The Producing Lab*
        takes place in Zagreb during Fantastic Zagreb in July. *The
        Marketing&Packaging Lab* takes place in Tallinn during PÖFF, in the
        final week of November.

        this year, presents films in the advanced stages of production or
        post-production, providing film professionals with a selection of 11
        promising projects from the Baltic region and Finland.


        This year’s selection brings a majority of projects mainly produced in
        Estonia. An anticipated historical drama ***Truth and Justice***
        directed by Academy Award nominated Tanel Toom and produced by the
        Golden Globe and Academy Award nominee Ivo Felt is based on a literary
        classic, one of the foundational Estonian literary works by Anton Hansen
        Tammsaare.


        Estonia is also represented by ***Goodbye Soviet Union*** (Estonia,
        Finland), the first full feature by Lauri Randla a coming-of-age drama
        taking place during the turbulent times of the collapse of the Soviet
        empire. This year’s selection brings also a more experimental sci-fi
        thriller ***Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway*** (Spain, Estonia,
        Ethiopia) by Miguel Llansó and debut features ***Rain*** (Estonia,
        Poland) by Janno Jürgens and a psychological drama ***Sandra Gets a
        Job*** by Kaupo Kruusiauk.


        Finland is represented by three projects this year, an artistic romantic
        comedy ***Aurora*** by the award-winning director Miia Tervo, and two
        dramas ***Dogs Don’t Wear Pants*** (Finland, Latvia) by the critically
        acclaimed and awarded J-P Valkeapää and ***Maria’s Paradise*** (Finland,
        Estonia) by Zaida Bergroth.


        Baltic Event is happy to welcome Juris Poskus’s new feature, a humorous
        ***24 hr Sunshine*** on the border of drama and comedy. His film Kolka
        Cool was selected to Tallinn Black Nights FF competition in 2011. Latvia
        is also represented by the historical drama ***City on the River***
        (Latvia, Czech Republic, Lithuania) by Viesturs Kairišs, whose
        *Chronicles of Melanie* was selected in the Official Selection of Black
        Nights in 2016.


        Lithuania brings one feature, a magical-realist ***The Flood Won’t
        Come*** by award-winning Marat Sargsyan to Baltic screens.


        #### Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event:


        “On the occasion of the centenary of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and
        the 101st anniversary of Finland, we are pleased to present 11 new films
        from the region, telling our stories from the past to the present from
        very different angles, by both debutants as well as established and
        awarded filmmakers. Our intertwined history and culture is also evident
        in the pleasingly plentiful co-productions, both on the traditional
        Estonian-Finnish-Latvian-Lithuanian-Polish axis as well as in the
        slightly more unusual direction of Spain-Ethiopia.

        With our two Works in Progress presentations, we are delighted to be
        able to boost 19 very different films on their flight to the stars.”

        The initiatives of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, Script Pool Tallinn
        and POWR Baltic Stories Exchange focusing on scriptwriting, announced
        selected projects – including participants from Chile, Turkey, Faroe
        Islands, Spain and Russia as well as Nordic and Central European
        countries, attending the programmes this year.
    contents_en: >
        [Script Pool Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/script-pool-tallinn/), an
        international script competition taking place for the 4th time in 2020,
        has announced its participants in its film category.  The main goal of
        the competition is to gather talented scriptwriters with producers
        attached and to provide them support in enhancing the script and
        maximising its production and distribution potential. During the
        competition the participants get to work together with well-known script
        doctors and pitching mentors. Each project will have the chance to pitch
        their story to a top specialist in the field and get one-to-one
        feedback. 


        According to Triin Tramberg, the manager of Script Pool, the global
        lockdown had an incredible influence on creating new films. “We had a
        record number of submissions and decision making was not easy at all.
        The five projects we selected differ from each other but are equally
        interesting to read and have great potential to thrive in the
        international film industry,” she added.   


        ##### Script Pool Film selected projects: 


        - *20,000 Species of Bees* (Spain), screenwriter Estibaliz Urresola
        Solaguren, from the production company Gariza Films and Sirimiri Films; 

        - *Franky Five Star* (Germany, Finland), screenwriters Knut Mierswe and
        Birgit Möller, production company Achtung Panda! 

        - *Ghost in The House* (Iceland), screenwriters Olaf de Fleur
        Johannesson and Hrafnkell Stefansson, production company Poppoli
        Pictures; 

        - *The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingo* (Chile), writer Diego Céspedes,
        production company Quijote Films; 

        - *A Smile Worthwhile* (Turkey, Estonia), screenwriter Sefa Öztürk,
        production company Purple Pigeon Productions.  


        The main award of 5000 Euro prize is given to a writer-producer team by
        the jury that includes **Patrick Fisher** (managing director of Creative
        Capital), **Patrik Andersson** (Producer of Midsommar, 2019, Euphoria,
        2017) and **Agathe Maurac** (Head of International Sales at Pyramide
        International). 


        [POWR Baltic Stories Exchange](https://poff.ee), organised for the 13th
        time, is a training programme for Nordic and Baltic scriptwriters,
        actively seeking producers, to develop film projects currently in the
        early stages of development. We will also host a project as part of
        Russia in Focus 2020. 


        “This year we are excited to welcome our first Faroese filmmaker and the
        stories cover a broad spectre including a post-alien invasion drama, a
        Latvian mockumentary, modern folklore and a Russian generational drama.
        We are 50/50 on the gender account and can’t wait to present a great mix
        of POWR pitches in November,” said Valeria Richter, Head of Studies for
        POWR since the start. 


        During the intensive group-based workshop taking place online during
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event (November 19-22), the selected
        screenwriters will practice the skills to pitch their projects through
        group sessions, talks and rehearsals. In 2020, the workshop is led by
        the 2 pitch coaches, Valeria Richter (Denmark) and Helene Granqvist
        (Sweden), both of the Nordic Factory outfit.

        In a few days, TV Beats, the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn &
        Baltic Event is about to kick-off! During **November 25-26**, TV Beats
        Forum *powered by Elisa* offers discussion panels, keynote interviews,
        presentations and workshops, as well as crossmatching events with other
        Industry@Tallinn activities. But what are the must-see fireside chats,
        case studies and lectures at TV Beats programme you can’t miss?


        #### Case study: ALL THE SINS


        A deep dive into the making of **Finnish crime drama series** ***All The
        Sins***, co-created and directed by Mika Ronkainen. We follow the
        project from pitch to screen, including what the plans are for season
        two. Kristian Taska (Producer, Taska Film), Ilkka Matila (Producer, MRP
        Matila Rohr Productions), Laura Kuulasmaa (Executive Producer for
        Original Programming, Elisa Corporation) and Merja Aakko (Scriptwriter)
        will shed light “behind-the-scenes” of *All the Sins*.


        #### Benjamin Harris’s workshop for scriptwriters


        During the TV Beats Lecture, **Ben Harris introduces and explains a
        Writers Room** – how does it work, what are the different kinds of
        Writers Room and what kind of models could work in the Baltic region?


        Ben Harris is the Creator, Writer and Executive Producer of new Netflix
        original series *Young Wallander*. Based on Henning Mankell’s iconic
        books, the 6-part serialised story focuses on the formative experiences
        – professional and personal – faced by Kurt Wallander as a recently
        graduated police officer in his early twenties, in contemporary society.
        Before Wallander, Ben was Writer and Executive Producer of *Devils*, a
        10-part financial thriller based on a novel by Guido Maria Brera,
        starring Patrick Dempsey and Alessandro Borghi, for Sky Italy.

        #### Fireside chat: ICELAND HEATS UP


        The tiny nation of Iceland punches above its weight in the creative
        industries, and TV drama is the latest sector to see an international
        boom. Kristinn Thordarson David Oskar Olafsson from leading Icelandic
        production services company Truenorth discuss the changes in local TV
        production and co-production and offers a case study of **the first
        Icelandic Netflix Original series,** ***The Valhalla Murders***, which
        will launch in January. 


        #### Case study: Chernobyl


        The groundbreaking **HBO series Chernobyl** has put Lithuania on the map
        in a new way. Lineta Miseikyte, the Lithuanian producer of the
        award-winning show, shares her experience and lessons learned from this
        international co-production.

        TV Beats Forum, the drama-series-oriented section of Industry@Tallinn &
        Baltic Event, presents high-profile case studies, previews new exciting
        series and looks at trends in commissioning alongside the challenges of
        series production in 2020.   
    contents_en: >-
        This year’s [TV Beats
        Forum](https://industry.poff.ee/tv-beats-forum-2/), taking place fully
        online on November 26-27, takes a closer look at how COVID has impacted
        global production. **Guy Bisson**, Research Director of leading
        analytics firm Ampere Analysis, shares new research about how the
        pandemic has influenced film and TV shoots in Europe and beyond in 2020,
        and what the forecast is for 2021. In addition, producers from across
        Europe discuss new solutions in producing and co-producing in the
        COVID-era.  


        **Marge Liiske**, head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented:
        “**Series have become just as important as films in our programme now**.
        TV Beats Forum has always aimed to act as a meeting point of creatives
        in the region to provide opportunities to share their experiences, to
        find new partners and ideas and to attract more international
        productions to shoot here. For the first time at TV Beats, MIDPOINT TV
        Launch presents nine exciting new series from Central and Eastern Europe
        in addition to the five projects taking part in Script Pool TV,” she
        added.   


        Another focus of TV Beats Forum in 2020 is gender equality. **Madeline
        Di Nonno**, CEO of Geena Davis Institute, will look into the latest
        trends in female representation in films and TV and see where the bright
        spots and challenges lay. To provide local insight, producers and
        broadcasters from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania look at the strides
        being made for women in the local film and TV industries and suggest the
        next steps.


        TV Beats Forum has always emphasised on sharing experiences and 2020 is
        no different. Among this year’s highlights is the case study of
        ***Stranger Things***, Netflix’s global hit that shot its fourth season
        in Lithuania. **Gary Tuck**, producer and managing director of Baltic
        Film Services, will share the challenges and the triumphs of the shoot.
        **Kateryna Vyshnevska** and **Olesya Lukyanenko** from Ukrainian
        production powerhouse Film.UA will shed some light to their global crime
        thriller *Hide and Seek*, forthcoming series *There Will Be People*,
        animated series Hrafn’s Academy, and new international co-productions.
        In addition, Estonian telecom Elisa presents their brand-new Estonian
        crime thriller *Line of Fire*.
         
        With Industry @Tallinn & Baltic Event offering Russia in Focus in 2020,
        TV Beats Forum follows the lead. Russian speakers will include the team
        from Moscow-based 1-2-3 Production, director **Evgeny Nikishov** and
        producer **Valery Fedorovich**, creators of the new Russian dramatic
        thriller *Dead Mountain –The Dyatlov Pass Incident*, inspired by the
        mysterious disappearance of a group of hikers in 1959.  **Aleksey
        Kiselev** from Art Pictures and **Irina Sosnovaya**, Creative Producer
        of Yellow Black & White, both considered to be Russia’s booming
        independent studios, will talk about production in Russia and share the
        best practices in co-production. Also they will give an insight to fresh
        titles from their slates including *Sherlock: Russian Chronicles and
        Psycho*.
         
        In addition to the focus on Russia, Germany also gets a closer look
        during TV Beats 2020. Germany’s hottest screenwriters including **Aron
        Lehmann** (The Last Word), **Thomas Stuber** (Hausen) and **Judit
        Banhazi** delve into their creative processes and talk about writing
        exciting shows that cut through the noise during the session “Germany –
        serious about series”. Also, a case study of *Deutschland 83* will
        welcome the show’s creator Jörg Winger. 


        Other top international speakers include Film i Väst head of production
        **Peter Possne**, ScreenSkills UK Head of Film and Animation **Gareth
        Ellis-Unwin**, NT Group EVP and Chief Content Officer **Filippa
        Wallestam** and leading attorney **Christoph Fey**. 


        The conversations and panel discussions will be led by TV Beats
        co-curator and host Wendy Mitchell, international film reporter Tom
        Grater (Deadline) and programmer and journalist Tara Karajica (Fade to
        Her).

        **POWR Baltic Stories Exchange** trains writers to deliver a good pitch
        and find a producer at the public project presentation as well as get
        industry feedback through pre-arranged POWR Meetings with carefully
        selected Baltic Event participants.


        The workshop was launched by our region’s MEDIA Desks with the goal to
        bring forward the young talent of the Nordic and Baltic countries. A few
        years into its success, POWR was moved under the Baltic Event
        Co-Production Market to give the participants an even wider forum to
        present their stories. Over the years, many participating projects have
        found a producer from Baltic Event.


        This year, POWR is partnering up with In Focus, a Finnish initiative
        aimed at female filmmakers that provides an incubator to support four
        film- or TV projects to cross the bridge from script to production
        stage. The initiative is funded by the Finnish Cultural Foundation. In
        Focus will pitch their projects in collaboration with POWR.


        Selected screenwriters will present their projects on November 29.

        Black Nights Film Festival is proud to partner with FotoInMotion, a new
        tool that will automatically turn still images into immersive short-form
        videos. But what will be the future of tools for digital content
        creation? FotoInMotion partners will shed some light upon the trends!
    contents_en: >-
        Based in Amsterdam, NOOR is one of the world’s leading photojournalism
        agencies and — like Black Nights — a pilot partner of FotoInMotion. Even
        if its roster of award-winning photographers has covered some of the
        most important stories over the past four decades, NOOR itself was only
        formed 12 years ago as a new model for a professional cooperative that
        maintains the time-honoured values and techniques of photojournalism
        with a commitment to explore new media and the cutting edges of
        technology.


        Like the films at POFF, NOOR was launched at an international festival.
        It was the 2007 edition of perhaps the world’s top such event for the
        photojournalism world: the *Visa pour L’Image* festival in the French
        city of Perpignan. 


        NOOR managing director Clement Saccomani has been coming to Perpignan
        for 15 years, dating back to his own start as a freelance photographer
        and his previous post as editorial director of the Magnum photo agency.
        At this year’s edition of *Visa pour L’Image* in September, Saccomani
        reflected on the state of photojournalism amid fast-changing technology
        and business realities, and the role of festivals to help drive the
        industry forward.


        #### For an agency like NOOR, why has Visa pour L’Image been so
        important?


        SACCOMANI: Perpignan has been the only place where you knew that all the
        important actors of the industry from around the world would show up. So
        it’s a great moment for photographers to show the work that is still
        unpublished but also to meet clients, colleagues and also the next
        generation of photojournalists and storytellers. It’s a moment to learn
        and share, and network. 


        #### How has the festival changed in recent years?


        There are more and more new digital actors and software manufacturers,
        and fewer media. There are more photographers, though fewer established
        top pros are coming every year like they used to. Technology has made
        the festival less important for some, but more important for others. 


        #### What do you say about the criticism that the festival has not
        evolved enough with the changing technology, that it’s remained
        basically the same, focused almost entirely on displaying still
        photographs?


        Most photographers today are not only working in still images from a
        camera but also producing moving images, using drones and their
        smartphones. There has to be room for this, to support new ways of doing
        journalism and support the creative process of video production for
        photojournalists.  NOOR photographers, Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van
        Lohuizen, completed a major project last year on the Arctic, which was
        the first time we reached 40% of our revenue from video.


        The large crowds at Visa seem to defy all the doom and gloom about the
        state of photojournalism, particularly economically. 


        There is a real growing infatuation with photography, and with
        journalism more generally, which you see in exhibitions and a festival
        like this. What I like so much about FotoInMotion is that it’s a tool to
        try to allow photojournalism to convert that interest and experience
        outside of physical exhibit space and into our regular consumption of
        content in the digital space.

        During the European Genre Forum Packaging Lab taking place during Black
        Nights Film Festival in Tallinn, teams of seven genre films will learn
        about sales and packaging from industry professionals with exhaustive
        experience. 
    contents_en: >-
        The European Genre Forum (EGF) is an annual training programme that sets
        to boost the careers of future European players in the genre film
        industry. In 2019 EGF consists of two talent labs – The Producers Lab
        **in Zagreb** and The Packaging Lab **in Tallinn**. During these two
        talent labs, participants who are working on their first or second film
        project, are able to discuss their project with consultants and mentors,
        learn about the different aspects of (co-)production, sales and
        packaging from industry professionals. At the two-day Packaging Lab in
        Tallinn – the last part of the training programme – teams will focus on
        developing pitching skills, followed by public pitching at the Industry
        @ Tallinn & Baltic Event. 


        The workshops are carried out by experienced marketing and sales
        agencies in the field of genre films from London (Coffee & Cigarettes)

        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event presents 14 TV and drama series projects
        in development: five participating in Script Pool TV competition and
        nine taking part in the MIDPOINT TV Launch 2020 3rd workshop.
    contents_en: "According to Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, it has been repeatedly pointed out that 2020 is a year when the demand for content has increased significantly, and drama series are now a natural part of many film industry events. “I am thrilled that together with MIDPOINT TV Launch, we have several new drama series projects from Europe onboard. In addition to the public pitching, we offer them a platform to set up one-to-one meetings with our industry guests, in order for them to find collaboration partners to proceed with their projects,” she adds.\n\nMIDPOINT TV Launch, a co-operating partner of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event since 2018, is an \"idea-to-market\" series project development program for creative teams of emerging professionals mostly coming from the Central and Eastern European region. Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event hosts the third and final workshop of MIDPOINT TV Launch 2020, with nine projects participating. \_The previous events taking place in June and September, all online due to the restrictions connected to the global pandemic.\n\n“During the last week in November, the participants of MIDPOINT TV Launch will be encouraged to explore the rich programme of the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, use the platform to network, and for the first time, present their projects at an industry event and market. The highlight of this third session is understandably the pitching of the graduating projects, followed by one-to-one meetings with the industry professionals and decision makers invited to the event,” Katarina Tomkova, Program Coordinator at MIDPOINT commented. “The HBO Europe Award of 5000 USD will be granted to the Best Project at the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event award ceremony,” she added. In addition, the MIDPOINT Institute will bring several panel discussions and events to the programme.\n\nScript Pool Tallinn, an international script competition taking place for the 4th time in 2020, presents five projects in its TV and drama series category, including projects from Poland, Italy, North Macedonia, a co-production from Latvia and Lithuania and a project from Estonia. Manager of Script Pool Tallinn, Triin Tramberg comments: “This year’s selection stands out, because while keeping our competition international, we see an increasing demand from regional series to take part at Script Pool. For the first time we have two Baltic projects in the competition, bringing a spotlight to the region.”\n\nScript Pool Tallinn’s main goal is to gather talented scriptwriters with producers attached and to provide them support in enhancing their scripts and maximising production and distribution potential. Before the competition, the participants get advice from well-known script doctors and pitching mentors. The main award of a 5000 Euro prize is given to two writer-producer teams – one for outstanding script in film and one in the TV series category.\n\nThe Script Pool TV/drama jury includes **Julie Hodge** (Fremantle, Editorial Director at Global Drama), **Anna Katharina Brehm** (Production and Content Director at Seriencamp Conference) and **Toomas Ili** (Head Of Content Acquisitions, Elisa).\n\_\n#### MIDPOINT TV Launch 2020 participating projects\n\n- *Afterparty* (Croatia), writer Dora Sustic, producer Maja Pek-Bruenjes\n- *Agents* (Serbia), writer Gvozden Djuric, producer/director Uros Tomic\n- *Hotel Intercontinental* (Hungary) writers Andras Voros and Peter Akar, producer Laszlo Dreissiger\n- *Hugo & Co.* (Czech Republic) writer Tomas Plhon, producer Gordon Lovitt\n- *Lazlo* (Latvia), writers Ermins Baltais and Kristina Martinuka, producer Aija Berzina\n- \_*Black Square* (Ukraine) writer/director Daria Onyshchenko, writer/producer Anna Palenchuk\n- *The Red Princess* (Czech Republic), writer Barbora Namerova, producer Milos Lochman\n- *The Neighbours* (Ukraine)\L writer/producer Alexandra Tkachenko, writer/producer \LMarina Chikalovets\n- *NOSTOS* (Greece) writer Stavros Pamballis and writer/producer Christos V.

        **How to Make Short Form Series**

        *Monday, 23 November 12:00 (EET)*


        The new digital era brought many new trends in storytelling, web series,
        also called short form series, being one of the most significant,
        bringing whole new perspectives and styles. Both major and independent
        content providers are exploring new ways to deliver original programmes
        specific to digital audiences. Short form series are, without any doubt,
        an attractive audiovisual field that allures many talented creative
        minds. But what are the main differences between the short form series
        and other forms of storytelling and what to keep in mind while creating

        **Filming Opportunities and Financial Incentives in Russian NorthWest**

        *Wednesday, November 25, 18:00 (EET)*


        Russia boosts the development of regional film commission institutions
        during the last two years. Now there are 18 regional film commissions
        developing their activity from Kaliningrad region to the West to
        Kamchatka region and Primorsky krai to the East of Russia. The regions
        of Russian Northwest like Kaliningrad, Karelia, Murmansk and Novgorod
        offer amazing shooting locations with beautiful landscapes close to
        European borders, which can be a decisive factor in terms of logistics
        of film crews. However, the most important aspect is economic gains and
        public financial support to foreign film producers. Launching of federal
        and regional rebate system will be the core subject of the round table
        discussion. Among the speakers are Svetlana Maksimchenko, Head of the
        Cinematography Department of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian
        Federation and Evgenia Danilchenko, Head of Creative Industries Export
        at the Russian Export Center.

        **Boundaries on the Cinema Screen - Content We Show or Choose to Show
        the Young Audience, Should it be Regulated and if so, by Whom?**

        *Thursday, November 26, 17:00 (EET)*


        What are the limitations of youth films nowadays? Is suitability for
        children and youth essentially a matter of opinion and depends on
        personal expectations and definitions of childhood? How important is a
        cultural pretext in defining youth film?


        The panel discussion takes place in cooperation with Just Film Festival
        and ECFA (European Children's Film Association)

        Giulia D’Agnolo Vallan, US Programmer at Venice International Film
        Festival, Natalie Brenner, Partner and Head of Sales at Metro
        International Entertainment, and Marija Razgutė, Producer at M-Films, to
        share their experiences since the pandemic started. They'll be
        discussing what the main challenges have been over the past few months
        and how some of the new ways of working may continue when the pandemic

        Script Pool Tallinn Presents Scripts for TV Drama Series for the First
        Time

        This year for the first time the international script competition Script
        Pool Tallinn also presents projects for TV drama series in addition to
        scripts for feature films. 
    contents_en: >-
        The main goal of Script Pool Tallinn, is to gather talented
        scriptwriters with producers attached, in order to provide them support
        enhancing the script and maximising its production and distribution
        potential. Adding the TV and drama series category to the competition
        for its 3rd edition can be considered as a reaction to the unavoidable
        change in the industry, where the series market is taking over and
        people prefer content by global streaming platforms. This gives an
        opportunity for local authentic stories to travel without language
        barriers. 


        “Since the very first year of the Script Pool competition, we have
        wanted it to have two directions – feature film and drama series,” Triin
        Tramberg, Script Pool competition coordinator comments. “We are more
        than excited to finally begin with the Script Pool TV drama series
        competition and especially that we can also show what kind of series
        Estonia makes,” she adds.


        At the Script Pool Tallinn event, six teams consisting of scriptwriters
        and producers will be at the open pitch on the 26th of November before
        the international  jury and other decision-makers from the industry
        including **Kamila Zlatušková**, Independent TV producer from the Czech
        Republic, **Dominic Schreiber**, Global Drama Executive, at leading
        independent drama producer and distributor, Reel One Entertainment and
        **Benjamin Harris**, a writer and producer with over 15 years experience
        in the industry. The winner of the competition receives a prize of 5000
        euros, provided by the leading international sales & distribution
        company Global Screen GmbH. 


        #### The selected projects for the TV drama category:


        - Produced by Estonian Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated
        production house Allfim in co-production with Sweden and Germany ***The
        Deep*** written by Lauri Lippmaa is a political crime thriller that
        raises the questions; Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we
        heading?


        - ***The Secret Society of Souptown and the Cucumber Mafia*** is an
        8-part TV-series sequel to the most successful Estonian family film by
        the well known Estonian screenwriters Andris Feldmanis and Livia Ulman,
        who have created several popular Estonian TV-series. Their debut feature
        film *Teesklejad* (*Pretenders*, director Vallo Toomla) was released in
        2016, having its world premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival.


        -  ***Court of Muses***, developed by Julia Effertz and Luxembourg’s
        Wady Films, is a bold and dark, unapologetic vision of female supremacy
        that has wandered all the way across the abyss of human nature.


        - ***The Holy Family*** is a family drama series with a supernatural
        twist. 17-year-old high school student Ábel might be a new Messiah, but
        his mysterious wrist wounds are considered suicide attempts by his
        family. The TV-series is written by Gábor Osváth, who was chosen to be
        one of the Emerging Producers (2016), and one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in
        2015. Yvonne Kerékgyártó is a SXSW Gamechanger award-winner
        scriptwriter-director of the 2014 feature *Free Entry*. More recently
        she was the screenwriter of *FOMO*, which had its international premiere
        at PÖFF.


        - ***Crossing place*** is a supernatural mystery drama about a writer in
        search of her boyfriend in an Irish border village and finds folklore
        seeping into reality. The series is by Gary Duggan, an award-winning
        playwright & screenwriter. His plays have been produced across Ireland,
        Europe and in New York.


        - ***Different*** is a horror anthology of ten loosely interconnected
        stories that explore the myths of Central Europe through the lives of
        different entities existing among us. The series wants to show different
        types of beings or creatures in several time periods struggling with the
        same dilemmas: is it a gift or a curse to be different? The series is
        created by Petr Koubek, a FAMU scriptwriting department graduate, who
        has written TV series for Czech Television Lynč, The Manor House,
        Národní klenoty and TV Nova Ulice, Dáma a Král and a number of
        commercials.


        Since 2018, Industry@Tallinn has partnered with
        [MIDPOINT](https://www.midpoint-center.eu/), a training and networking
        platform with the aim to strengthen the creative collaboration between
        writers, directors and producers in the development process in Central
        and Eastern Europe.

        The selection includes seven new Russian series, the latest work by
        two-time Academy Award nominee Steve James and the world premiere of
        Estonian thriller In the Line of Fire.
    contents_en: >-
        Entering its third year, the TV Beats section sees a programme
        introducing exciting new series to the festival’s audience and industry,
        backed by a busy virtual programme of panels and case studies that has
        already been announced.


        Having the world premiere at Black Nights, Estonian series In the **Line
        of Fire** is produced for the VOD platform Huub by Elisa, the festival’s
        main sponsor. Inspired by real life events, the 6-episode action-drama
        brings out some sore questions of our time. An Afghan War veteran,
        deeply disappointed in life, starts to detonate bombs in Tallinn, trying
        to fix the world he regards as broken, leading to a cat and mouse
        between him and a controversial top investigator of the security
        services.


        The past years have seen first screenings of several new Russian series
        for the first time outside their country of origin that have later
        become international success stories. Last year’s entry from Russia
        screened under the name Outbreak and later became a top-watched series
        on Netflix under the name To The Lake. Another Russian series, **Call
        Center**, by directing duo **Natasha Merkulova** and **Alexey Chupov**
        („The Man Who Surprised Everyone“, „Intimate Parts“) had its world
        premiere at Black Nights.


        This year Russia is headed by **Psycho**, created by the prolific
        director Fedor Bondarchuk and producer (Stalingrad, Arrival, Invasion)
        who presents the tale of a elitist psychotherapist Oleg on the eve of
        his 40-s birthday. He shares an apartment with his mother and suffers
        from a middle age crisis, lack of self-respect, drug addiction,
        irritability and increasing aggression.

        A year ago Oleg’s wife disappeared – she has been missing for 384
        days...


        Karen Oganesyan’s **The Big Game** offers survival and psychological
        thriller about the participants of an extreme reality show.


        After screening the first season of the hit series **An Ordinary Woman**
        by director-scriptwriter **Nataliya Meshchaninova** („Heart of the
        World“, „The Hope Factory“), the story of the brothel keeper Marina
        continues as she has a baby and gets into trouble with some mobsters.


        In **Chicks** four female sex workers try to start a brand-new life in a
        small, patriarchal and religious Russian town – and face immediate
        consequences for their brave act.


        **Dead Mountain – The Dyatlov Pass Incident** is a fresh take on
        infamous Dyatlov incident, based on the de-classified files of the
        real-life case that has had people spinning wild theories all over the
        world for more than 60 years, ranging from avalanches, to secret weapon
        tests, to alien interference.


        **Sherlock: The Russian Chronicles** is a glossy mystery and action
        thriller throws a Russian spin on one of the world’s most famous
        characters. The series follows the esteemed detective from London to the
        Russian Empire, on the trail of a suspected serial murderer.


        Director Arkadiy Nepytalyuk’s **There will be People** depicts the
        turbulent periods of the beginning of the 20th century through the eyes
        of ordinary people: the First World War, the revolution, the emergence
        of Soviet regime.


        Among the other European countries in the selection are the Spanish
        series **Tell Me Who I Am** that begins in the year 1998 when a man by
        the leaves a thick biography on the desk of a successful publisher. It
        is the story of Javier’s mother he never knew. Before fate can finally
        reunite mother and son, Amelia will have taken a long journey, starting
        in tumultuous Madrid of 1934.


        Danish **Cry Wolf** is the intense and emotional story of a teenage girl
        who has written a vivid school essay detailing her stepfather’s violent
        behavior. The parents deny the accusations, but who is lying – and who
        is telling the truth?


        **Swiss Labyrinth of Peace** offers a high-budget portrait of an
        industrial family dynasty that is inspired by true yet little-known
        events in post-WWII „neutral“ Switzerland where the dark secrets reveal
        the amoral choices taken by many people in places of political and
        financial power.


        From outside of Europe, TV Beats screens the Brazilian series **Basic
        Unit** that is inspired by real life cases, telling the story in of two
        physicians of a basic care unit in Brazil, faced by challanges created
        by both their work and very opposing views.


        In US series **City So Real**, Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Steve
        James’ („Hoop Dreams“) fascinating and complex portrait of contemporary
        Chicago delivers a deep, multifaceted look into the soul of a
        quintessentially American city, set against the backdrop of its
        history-making 2019 mayoral election, and the tumultuous 2020 summer of
        COVID-19 and social upheaval following the police killing of George
        Floyd.

        Comment from the jury:

        We were enchanted by the world writer/director Estibaliz Urresola
        Solaguren created in this poignant and personal journey of young Lucia
        making the biggest decision of her life during a hot summer holiday in
        rural Spain. We were especially impressed by Solaguren’s characters and
        her strong vision of the story, it’s allegories and it’s setting. We
        hope that winning the Black Nights Film Festival Script Pool 2020 prize

        **Script Pool TV Award**


        Winner: [When You Fall](https://industry.poff.ee/project/when-you-fall/)

        Scriptwriter: Biljana Crvenkovska

        Production company: OXO Production. North Macedonia

        Comment from the jury:

        The creators of the winning project have meticulously researched the
        world in which their story is based, immersing themselves deeply into
        this world that they want to create, and bringing a unique local
        viewpoint, while also weaving in themes that will resonate beyond their
        own borders.

        They have put a lot of thought not just into the story that they want to
        tell on the page, but into how they might better reach their intended
        audience online and make them fall in love with the characters, whilst
        also making an impact on their lives for the better.

        Crucially, we were also delighted to see some diversity in the
        characters, which was woven into the plot in a very natural way.

        Finally, we felt that the writer and producers’ passion for their
        subject matter leapt off the page, creating a show that hooks you from
        the beginning with intriguing believable characters and a layered
        mystery that is slowly unpeeled across the series.

        Creative Capital, Patrik Andersson, Producer of Midsommar (2019),

        Music Meets Film, a part of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, taking
        place for the 8th time has announced its programme and focuses on film
        music composers’ source of creativity this year. The exhaustive
        programme brings together award-winning British composer Richard Harvey,
        forensic musicologist Peter Oxendale as well as renown composers Michael
        J McEvoy, Tom Player and Mihkel Zilmer.


        Music Meets Film, curated by Estonian Music Producer and Music Editor
        Michael Pärt, brings together composers and directors; from music and
        sound creatives through to producers, agents and the wider music – and
        film industry. It is to build bridges between creatives, grow as an
        interdisciplinary meeting place and encourage new International
        collaborations


        The first day of the programme introduces current **scoring trends and
        the future direction** of the industry, presented by award-winning
        composers from England, Finland and Estonia. We will also learn about
        the importance of production music and making the most out of music
        licensing.


        The second day is held at the recently opened **Arvo Pärt Centre in
        Laulasmaa**, with British forensic musicologist and copyright
        infringement specialist **Peter Oxendale** speaking about common
        copyright misconceptions followed by **three case studies by renowned
        film composers Richard Harvey, Michael J McEvoy and Mihkel Zilmer**. The
        day will conclude with a feature-length documentary film “Making Waves:
        The Art of Cinematic Sound” (2019), directed by Midge Costin. Throughout
        this day we will hear the sound through Estelon’s flagship loudspeakers
        “Estelon Extreme”. Estelon is an Estonian hi-end loudspeaker maker and a
        partner of the Arvo Pärt Centre.


        On the third day, at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre, MMF
        takes an in-depth approach through **masterclasses and composing
        mentorship sessions**. American Multi-instrumentalist and composer
        Michael McEvoy takes a detailed look at a thematic approach within film
        scoring and explores the world of “leitmotifs”. Composer Tom Player
        leads a masterclass focusing on Physical vs. Virtual instruments and
        composer Mihkel Zilmer will share his experience from score spotting
        sessions with directors. 


        The 8th Music Meets Film takes place 25-27 November, 2019. In 2019 Music
        Meets Film partners up with West One Music, a British production music
        company established in the heart of London’s Soho in 2002.

        Molly tells us a story we are not familiar with, but we would love to
        watch on screen. It is easy to get connected with the characters and
        their internal conflicts in the love story set in the politics of cold
        war and frozen Greenland. We believe Molly could be an original and
        captivating film.


        The jury of Script Pool Tallinn: Celine Dornier, Executive Producer at
        Logical Pictures, Yaron Shamir, Programmer and Special Events
        Coordinator at Haifa International Film Festival and Jennyfer Gautier,
        Buyer and international sales at UDI –Urban Distribution International.


        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event congratulate all selected projects and
        the winners!


        Congratulations to all the winners at Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event!

        How can we create a diverse and sustainable film industry? The Embassy
        of Sweden in Tallinn is hosting WIFTI Talks this Sunday – three European
        researchers will share their perspectives.


        In three 10-minute talks followed by a panel discussion with filmmakers,
        Valeria Villegas Lindvall (University of Gothenburg), Elen Lotman
        (Tallinn University) and Dr. Lina Kaminskaitė-Jančoreinė (Lithuanian
        Academy of Music and Theatre) will cover grounds from the importance of
        using statistics and transparency to how monsters in film can have an
        impact on gender hierarchies. The discussion is moderated by Helene
        Granqvist, President of WIFT International.


        The event will be hosted by Swedish Ambassador Mikael Eriksson.


        The Embassy will also offer drinks and snacks after the talks.


        Please register for the event via e-mail rsvp.tallinn@gov.se


        *Established by Women in Film & Television International, the WIFTI
        Talks are a series of live and online talks to crack the nut of how to
        make the film industry more gender-balanced. With international scholars
        from gender, media and film studies field, we gather knowledge,
        different perspectives and daring ideas on how to address inequality
        that might lead us even beyond gender and film.*

        On the 26th of November, as a result of the collaboration between PÖFF,
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event and the European Film Academy, film
        industry professionals will meet with young local designers, creatives,
        and promising film actors of the future. PÖFF BlackWalk, the exclusive
        gala of young talent, has been launched with the aim to help industry
        professionals discover young and emerging talent.
    contents_en: >-
        Festival director Tiina Lokk considers the event highly important. “PÖFF
        BlackWalk is the first step in creating a cohesive network of training
        programs that bring people together from different areas of the film
        industry. The EFA has around 3000 professional members across Europe –
        our collaboration means to use this network and channel it into the
        local education system”.


        This year’s project is a development of last year’s PÖFF: Black Catwalk.
        Laura Kurs, the event’s head organiser confirms that this year’s program
        is one step closer to what they really want to achieve. “We want to
        create a sustainable education program for our young film lovers. By
        working with the EFA, we are able to establish direct contact with film
        industry professionals and build lasting relationships with them.
        Hopefully, we will be able to arouse an indelible affection towards film
        in costume designers, make-up, hair and video artists,” she adds.


        In this year’s program knowledge and advice is shared by: visual artist
        **Peter Hjorth** (*Antichrist, Melancholia, Nymphomaniac: Vol I*),
        make-up artist **Dalia Colli** (Dogman, Casanova), hair artist **Daniela
        Tartari** (*Broken Embraces, Like Crazy*) and costume designer
        **Stefanie Bieker** (*Land of Mine, Only Lovers Left Alive*). 


        PÖFF BlackWalk’s gala will feature three mini-collections, which are
        created with the specifics of costume art in mind and which are inspired
        by the selected films of the young Estonian designers – Annika Kiidron,
        Liina Liesment and Reila Saarmäe. The fashion show with an emphasis on
        the film industry is also the culmination of a two-month training
        program in which young fashion designers, make-up, hair and video
        artists were lectured and supported by the EFA’s acknowledged creative
        directors.


        PÖFF BlackWalk’s gala night will take place on 26 of November in
        Noblessner’s Valukoda. In addition to fashion designers and creatives,
        the event also acknowledges young promising film actors participating in
        the Black Nights Stars program. The event is part of the
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event program for film professionals at the
        Black Nights Film Festival and the Creative Gate project funded by the
        European Regional Development Fund. PÖFF BlackWalk is supported by
        Enterprise Estonia, Toyota and Balmain Hair Couture Estonia.

        Yesterday evening we were delighted to announce the first winners of
        this year’s industry awards: Just Film Works in Progress Award and
        Script Pool TV Award.

    contents_en: >-
        **Just Film Works in Progress** is a newly introduced category at
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event Works in Progress focusing on children
        and youth film projects with five projects competing for the award. Just
        Film Works in Progress Award was handed out for **Durim Kryeziu’s
        project** ***Family*** from Kosovo. According to the jury’s comment, the
        project spoke about the transition in a family and coming to terms with
        the country’s recent history in a way that is accessible for the young
        audience, through music. The award-winner receives 1000 EUR monetary
        prize to help the film gain visibility by covering promotion and

        director of Castellinaria Film Festival for Youngsters in Bellinzona CH.


        This year Script Pool Tallinn, an international script competition for
        film, added TV and drama series category as a reaction to the
        unavoidable change in the industry, where the series market is taking
        over, and people prefer content by global streaming platforms. After six
        teams of scriptwriters and producers pitching, the jury decided to hand
        out **Script Pool TV Award** to **Lauri Lippmaa’s** ***The Deep***. The
        winner receives an award of 5000 Euro prize by leading international
        sales & distribution company [Global Screen
        GmbH](https://www.globalscreen.de/mm/en/). 


        Script Pool TV international jury included Kamila Zlatušková,
        Independent TV producer from the Czech Republic, Dominic Schreiber,
        Global Drama Executive, at leading independent drama producer and
        distributor, Reel One Entertainment and Benjamin Harris, a writer and
        producer with over 15 years’ experience in the industry. 


        Also, *The Deep* received a [The Hypewriter

        18 films in production or post-production looking for sales agents or
        festivals for international premieres will be presented at the
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event Work in Progress sessions on November
        the 26 and 27th. 


        Both the Baltic Event, showcasing Baltic and Finnish projects, as well
        as International Works in Progress, compete for the same awards this
        year – the Post Production Award by Post Control, a Helsinki based
        high-end post-production house, in the amount of 10 000 EUR and the
        Baltic Event Works in Progress Award in the amount of 3000 EUR. 


        The jury is comprised of cinematographer and festival curator Dhanushka
        Gunathilake (Sri Lanka), distributor Debra Liang (Level K, Denmark) and
        journalist and festival programme Alissa Simon –  (Palm Springs IFF, 
        Chicago IFF, USA).


        #### Baltic Event Works in Progress


        Baltic Event Works in Progress programme, held for the 17th time this
        year, presents a selection of 10 promising projects from the Baltics and
        Finland.


        “I am very proud of the list of projects we have this year. Baltic Event
        Works in Progress includes 10 outstanding films in production or
        post-production from the Baltic states and Finland. The programme gives
        an excellent overview of the best our region has to offer,” commented
        Maria Ulfsak, the Project Manager of Baltic Event Works in Progress.


        The Baltic Event Works in Progress includes three projects from
        **Estonia** – youth comedy ***Kids of the Night*** by director Priit
        Pääsuke that tells the story of three sisters during one fateful night,
        tragicomical ***On the Water*** by veteran director Peeter Simm that
        focuses on the life of a preadolescent boy growing up with his
        grandparents in small-town Soviet Estonia and ***O2*** by Margus Paju, a
        spy thriller set in 1939, co-produced by Estonia, Finland, Latvia and
        Lithuania.


        **Latvia** is represented with three projects – ***In the Mirror***
        (Latvia, Lithuania) is a contemporary version of the well known
        fairy-tale Snow White by renowned director Laila Pakalniņa. ***The
        Pit*** by Dace Pūce follows a boy named Markuss adapting to a new life
        with his grandmother. ***Where the Road Leads*** (Latvia, Sweden) is the
        first Baltic western, the debut feature by Matiss Kaza. 


        **Lithuanian** producer Dagnė Vildžiūnaitė is representing the
        long-awaited debut by director Tomas Smulkis – a Vilnius-based multiplot
        ***People We Know Are Confused***. The drama ***Paralysis*** (Lithuania,
        Czech Republic) is the new project by Andrius Blaževičius whose debut
        feature ***The Saint*** (2016) premiered at Busan and Warsaw and
        received six Lithuanian Film Academy Awards.


        **Finland** brings two projects to Baltic Event Works in Progress –
        drama/comedy ***Eden***, a coming-of-age film about a Protestant
        Confirmation camp, written and directed by Ulla Heikkilä; and ***Ladies
        of Steel***, a comedy by director Pamela Tola about three elderly ladies
        and their journey through Finland filled with memories and sinful
        dancing.



        #### International Works In Progress


        The fifth **International Works in Progress** showcases eight projects
        from around the world. “A number of them are presenting their first
        feature, so there is some new promising talent to explore,” Triin
        Tramberg, Project Manager of International Works in Progress explained.


        **Hungry Saints** is the first feature of award-winning short filmmaker
        Marc Wilkins, Switzerland, backed by producer Joël Jent (Iraqi Odyssey).
        After the success of System Crasher by Nora Fingscheidt, the production
        company Weydemann Brothers, Germany, brings their new project in
        progress ***Schoko*** by debutant Sarah Blaßkiewitz to Tallinn. Yet
        another first feature is the coming-of-age story ***Hilda*** by Rishi
        Pelham with Tim Roth on board as executive producer. Juraj Bohuš, from
        Slovak Republic, is also making its debut with ***Stand Up***. The
        awarded short film maker Ferit Karahan from Turkey presents his second
        feature ***Deskmate***. Moving to Central Asia, where the International
        Works in Progress has always included a project from, we welcome yet
        another debutant, Maxim Dashkin with ***Far Frontiers***, a
        co-production between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. This years’ summit’s
        spotlight, Argentina, rounds up the slate with two projects: ***One
        Thousand And One*** by Clarisa Navas and ***French Braid*** by Lucas
        Turturro.

        Black Nights Film Festival is proud to partner with FotoInMotion, a new
        tool that will automatically turn still images into immersive short-form
        videos. But what will be the future of tools for digital content
        creation? FotoInMotion partners will shed some light upon the trends!


        “Visual content” has become an all-encompassing category that can mean
        different things depending on who’s creating or consuming or selling it.
        Still most of us can agree about what is and what is not a photograph:
        whether printed or pixelated, color or black and white, fine art or
        breaking news or the sunset shot from your summer vacation.  


        At the same time, of course, the digital revolution has changed
        everything. For better and worse. By most
        [estimates](https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/pilotonline.com/), more than
        one trillion images are taken a year, up from 80 billion in 2000. Our
        smartphones and social media mean anyone can be a published photographer
        — anywhere, anytime. That’s the good news and bad news. It’s bad news
        not only for those who try to make a living from it, but also for the
        rest of us who might not see the best or most relevant images in the
        constant stream of often mediocre (or pointless) photographs. 


        Still, a whole [new
        generation](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/a-filmmaker-and-photographers-urgent-personal-portraits-of-harlem-at-night)
        of multimedia storytellers and technologists are helping to figure out
        how to take advantage of the opportunities the digital revolution offers
        photography. The advertising, entertainment, art and information
        industries are pushing the boundaries around 3D imaging, augmented
        reality, and new formats like
        [cinemagraphs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeI_w3qHU29/?taken-by=flixelphotos)
        that partially animate images. 


        Some of it is pretty cool, but much of it is not really photography —
        that unique experience that a still image offers by capturing a moment,
        scene or something else that will never be quite the same. 


        [FotoInMotion](https://fotoinmotion.eu/) is a new European
        Commission-backed project to build a digital tool to bridge the divide
        between the timeless power of photography and the new potential offered
        by information technology. The aim of the FotoInMotion tool is to use
        automation to efficiently turn any photograph into an immersive video
        for storytelling, journalistic and marketing purposes — a way to make
        great photographers come to life and transmit information in the endless
        stream of visual content.


        <iframe width="560" height="315"

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media;
        gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



        The FotoInMotion desktop and mobile tool will allow both creative
        content producers and the creative public to efficiently produce
        high-quality videos from still photography, relying on AI-driven
        automated editing functions and dynamic effects.


        Black Night Film Festival is a key partner in the project, overseeing a
        major pilot program to test and exploit the tool during its annual
        festival. Over the coming weeks, there will be more articles from
        [FotoInMotion’s partners](https://fotoinmotion.eu/partners/), who hail
        from six industry sectors and six different European countries,
        exploring what it means to be a visual storyteller. And what it means to
        be a photograph.

        Creative gate workshops: 


        **HOW TO MARKET YOUR FILM?** 


        **Deborah Rowland’s workshop for producers**


        April, 16-17 Tallinn Nordic Hotel Forum 


        **Event is postponed. New dates will be announced when possible. Stay
        safe!**


        Creative Gate is inviting producers, scriptwriters, distributors and
        other filmmakers from our region to a two-day workshop on how to
        maximise the release of a film. The workshop will be held by Deborah
        Rowland who has over 28 years of experience in marketing and all aspects
        of film distribution: theatrical, home entertainment, VOD, international
        sales, TV, and exhibition.


        **The Workshop will consist of two parts** that are open to the public:


        – **What Not to Do** – Deborah will talk for 1,5h about the biggest
        mistakes that are usually made when preparing a film for release, and
        how you can avoid them and give your film the best chance of success in
        distribution


        – **How to Pitch Your Film** – Pitching is more than just telling the
        story of your film. With Cannes and other major festivals approaching,
        knowing how to attract the best sales agents, distributors and
        financiers to your film is critical. Deborah will talk you through how
        to structure and deliver your finest pitch.

        your finest pitch.


        Up to 8 projects will then have the opportunity for **one on one
        sessions** with Deborah on their specific projects. Deborah will take 45
        minutes for each project to look at their materials – promotional
        stills, poster, synopsis and trailer (if ready) – and discuss your
        marketing and distribution plans to maximise the outcome of your
        project.

        programme of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event presents case-studies of
        several high-profile TV series. Wendy Mitchell and Kathleen McInnis
        moderate the two-day event with an interesting programme. 
    contents_en: >+
        Among this year’s highlights of the TV Beats Forum is the case study of
        the highly acclaimed HBO series ***Chernobyl*** with the series
        Lithuanian co-producer UAB Baltic Film Services producer **Lineta
        Miseikyte** (production manager of Defiance, 2008). During the
        discussion, Miseikyte will provide the perspective from a local
        production house working with a major studio on a production that kept
        growing throughout and took place in three different jurisdictions
        simultaneously – the US, UK and Lithuania. 


        **Marge Liiske**, head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event commented: “We
        are extremely excited to continue working with our regions creative
        talents. We are always seeking ways to improve local series production
        and storytelling, and to attract more international productions to shoot
        here. One of our long-term goals is to build a regional series content
        market in Tallinn primarily aimed at the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian
        countries (including Iceland) and Ukraine, similar to what we are doing
        with films in the Baltic Event co-production market.”


        Another high-profile international co-production in focus this year is
        ***The Feed***, starring David Thewlis and Michelle Fairley and written
        by Channing Powell (producer of *Walking Dead*). The series premiered in
        the UK via Virgin Media in September and will be available on Amazon
        Prime elsewhere. Three all3media international representatives –
        Executive Vice President of EMEA & European Co-Productions **Stephen
        Driscoll**, Acquisitions Executive **Laura White** and Sales Manager
        **Debra Bergg** – will be sharing their experience on working with the
        four companies that were involved in production: Studio Lambert in
        association with all3media international, Liberty Global and Amazon. 


        The third case study highlights the growing efforts and successes of
        Finnish-Estonian co-production by focusing on the Finnish crime series
        ***All the Sins***, funded by Finnish telecommunication service provider
        Elisa that has recently opened its own VOD service as well. Speakers
        include series creator/writer **Mika Ronkainen** (was co-created and
        co-written with Merja Aakko), producer **Ilkka Matila** and the Estonian
        co-producer **Kris Taska**. 


        Also among the speakers at TV Beats Forum is Icelandic producer
        **Kristinn Thordarson** (Kristinn Þórðarson) explaining how the tiny
        isolated country has become a hotspot for international production and
        manages to create series that travel globally. Thordarson will be
        sharing her experience working on ***The Valhalla Murders***, the first
        series that Netflix has produced in Iceland.


        This year’s TV Beats Forum also tackles VOD content creation in Russia.
        The discussion round welcomes the team behind the new series ***Call
        Center***, as the creators **Natasha Merkulova** and **Alexey Chupov**
        (directors of the 2018 Venice Official Competition entry *The Man Who
        Surprised Everyone*) and producers **Valeriy Fedorovich** and **Evgeniy
        Nikishov** from Premier Studios (behind series Gogol and *An Ordinary
        Woman*, which have screened in the festival’s TV Beats programme
        previously) are confirmed as speakers. Call center follows employees of
        an online sex-shop, who find themselves shut inside their office by
        terrorists, who call themselves “Mommy and Daddy”. 


        **TV Beats Forum** is the newest addition to the Industry@Tallinn &
        Baltic Event conference programme held during [Tallinn Black Nights Film
        Festival](https://2019.poff.ee/), reacting to the real demand of the
        industry as the series market is taking over from film, and the demand
        for content by global streaming platforms is ever increasing.


        TV Beats Forum will take place on **November 25 and 26, 2019**. Over the
        two days, various discussion panels, keynote interviews, presentations
        and workshops, as well as crossmatching events with other
        Industry@Tallinn activities will take place. 


        [Check out the full programme of TV Beats
        Forum](https://industry.poff.ee/tv-beats-forum-2/) with intriguing

        **MIDPOINT TV Launch HBO Europe Award** (5 000 USD) 


        Winner: [*Afterparty*](https://industry.poff.ee/project/afterparty/)
        (Croatia) 

        Writer: Dora Sustic 

        Producer: Maja Pek-Bruenjes 


        In the words of Steve Matthews, who handed over the award on behalf of
        HBO Europe: 

        “The difficulties of running the MIDPOINT programme online this year
        have certainly not resulted in any loss of quality: the participants all
        rose to the challenge with professionalism and innovation. As always
        this was a very difficult decision: several of the projects displayed
        extremely high levels of craft and attainment from teams who were
        collaborative and determined always to keep pushing themselves. But one
        stood out for having achieved those craft objectives, but which also
        displayed an additional spark of personal passion and the courage to
        explore difficult and controversial modern topics with great honesty. A
        writer’s job is to explore an issue, not to preach about it – and for
        that reason the winner of this years’ HBO Europe prize is AFTERPARTY.“ 


        **SCRIPT POOL TALLINN 2020**


        Script Pool Film and TV Award for is given to an outstanding script in
        Film and TV series category (a 5 000 EUR). 


        **Script Pool Film Award** 


        Winner: [*20,000 Species of
        Bees*](https://industry.poff.ee/project/20-000-species-of-bees/)

        Screenwriter Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren 

        Production company: Gariza Films and Sirimiri Films. Spain 

        Comment from the jury: 

        We were enchanted by the world writer/director Estibaliz Urresola
        Solaguren created in this poignant and personal journey of young Lucia
        making the biggest decision of her life during a hot summer holiday in
        rural Spain. We were especially impressed by Solaguren’s characters and
        her strong vision of the story, it’s allegories and it’s setting. We
        hope that winning the Black Nights Film Festival Script Pool 2020 prize
        helps this project to advance from development to production and we look
        forward to seeing it in competition at major film festivals in 2022! 


        **Script Pool TV Award** 


        Winner: [*When You
        Fall*](https://industry.poff.ee/project/when-you-fall/)

        Scriptwriter: Biljana Crvenkovska 

        Production company: OXO Production. North Macedonia 

        Comment from the jury: 

        The creators of the winning project have meticulously researched the
        world in which their story is based, immersing themselves deeply into
        this world that they want to create, and bringing a unique local
        viewpoint, while also weaving in themes that will resonate beyond their
        own borders.  

        They have put a lot of thought not just into the story that they want to
        tell on the page, but into how they might better reach their intended
        audience online and make them fall in love with the characters, whilst
        also making an impact on their lives for the better. 

        Crucially, we were also delighted to see some diversity in the
        characters, which was woven into the plot in a very natural way. 

        Finally, we felt that the writer and producers’ passion for their
        subject matter leapt off the page, creating a show that hooks you from
        the beginning with intriguing believable characters and a layered
        mystery that is slowly unpeeled across the series. 


        Script Pool Film Jury included Patrick Fisher, managing director of
        Creative Capital, Patrik Andersson, Producer of Midsommar (2019),

        Production company: Dansu films, Lithuania 

        Jury comment: I Am Fine, Thanks by talented Lithuanian helmer Ernestas
        Jankauska, who creates with his dedicated team a thoughtful artistic
        daring vision of an important, but in our society often neglected and
        seldom discussed topic: panic attack driven protagonist Maria is
        portrayed with a convincing visual concept — starting from the poster,
        ending with the intense DoP work. 


        Winner: [*Neon Spring*](https://industry.poff.ee/project/neon-spring/),
        directed by Matīss Kaža 

        Producers: Dace Siatkovska, Matīss Kaža 

        Production company: Deep Sea Studios. Latvia 

        Jury comment: Neon Spring is a young and contemporary story full of
        honesty and struggles that portrays the dichotomy between the promising
        and exciting youth of a teenager discovering her own future and the
        harsh reality of a broken relationship with her parents and the nude
        cruelty of an imperfect world far from Instagram pictures. 


        **Just Film Works in Progress Award**

        Youth and Children’s Film Festival Just Film is the biggest sub-festival
        of Tallinn Black Nights Film Festivals. 

        The award-winner receives 1000 EUR monetary prize to help the film gain
        visibility by covering promotion and publicity costs. 

        Jury comment: This one particular pitch convinced us, because of a very
        intriguing scene that shows a wonderful cast of child actors. A quite
        intense situation that’s somewhat casually narrated. Aiming at the age
        group of children between 10-12, this film seems to be a promising way
        to create awareness for ethical problems, to discuss what is right and
        what is wrong. 


        Winner: [*The Sleeping
        Beast*](https://industry.poff.ee/project/the-sleeping-beast/) by Jaak

        **The New Playbook: Resilience, Foresight, Transformation**


        **Time**: November 23, 2020 16.00 – 19.00 EEST / 15.00 – 18.00 CET


        **Venue**: Online at https://industry.poff.ee/


        [Watch European Film Forum Tallinn 2020 as catchup
        here](https://poff.elisastage.ee/landing/bc/mZ1D2CpUpk/oXu2e2hmD74)


        The year 2020 has been like no other before for the European and the
        global film industry. The explosive shock, unprecedented in its breadth
        and impact, has not only imploded the full value chain of cinema but has
        brought to the forefront the most significant challenges the medium and
        the industry has faced since its birth – whichever angle one takes.


        The European independent sector has witnessed perhaps the hardest, with
        all but a few significant festivals canceled, productions suspended, and
        distribution chains are broken with cinemas and audiences coping with on
        the national lockdown fronts.


        From a global perspective, perhaps 2020 has been the best year ever for
        watching, with accounts showing a tremendous spike in the consumption of
        audiovisual content and a staggering 79% increase in streaming hours,
        leading some of the super players to gap the quality of their services.


        As paradoxical it might seem, the global COVID epidemic has not derailed
        the film industry by surprise as many would love to believe, but
        savagely accelerated the already current transformation processes. For a
        fact, few players emerging with the bounty while many are jogging
        dazedly behind.


        Thus, the new playbook for a new normal is here – the question is how to
        define opportunities, strategies, and best practices and transform fast
        with foresight and resilience before it’s too late.


        The European Film Forum, as a debate and discussion platform on the
        future evolution of European cinema and film industry, will return to
        Tallinn on November 23, 2020, with a half a day virtual and hybrid
        summit of executive-level debates, case studies, and showcases on the
        most pressing topics for the European film, television, and content
        industry at the time of COVID.


        **The focus themes of the 2020 edition are:**


        - The new industry leadership playbook at the time of COVID19 Pandemic –
        how to transform successfully through resilience and foresight

        - Redefining windows and rights: a time for European film distribution
        and exhibition value chain 2.0

        - Reaching the audience during a lockdown: A deep dive into the best
        practices of VOD, Livestreaming, Watch Parties and Alternative
        Distribution

        - Reimagining Film Festivals during lockdown: How have festivals
        adapted, failed, or succeeded and how to define the future role of the
        festivals at the European level and beyond

        - European Frontieres: The public-private model and European Copyright
        Infrastructure as an example of future European catalyst


        Join the half-day hybrid and virtual summit and debate, learn, and
        network with 100+ European and global industry executives,
        entrepreneurs, and policymakers shaping European cinema’s future.


        The European Film Forum is organized by the Tallinn Black Nights Film

You can also check your agenda anytime by logging into\_industrymeet.poff.ee.\n\n#### HOW TO WATCH FILMS?\n\n- All accredited professionals should have received an invitation to access proscreen.poff.ee. Please accept the invitation and create yourself a user on the page.  \n- Log in at [proscreen.poff.ee](proscreen.poff.ee) using Edge (PC) or Safari (Mac) browsers.   \n- Find the film you want to watch and enjoy!  \n\n#### NB!  \n- Please write to festivalassistant@poff.ee if you need any help.  \n- Please note that Industry ACCESS accreditation does not include the option to watch films at festival’s online platform.  \n- Due to security reasons recently found in Google's backend systems, currently, only the following browsers can be used to watch films on the festivals web platforms proscreen.poff.ee and kino.poff.ee: EDGE (PC) and Safari (Mac). This is to protect the interests of the film’s rights holders and filmmakers.  \n- Please note that the whole programme is not available on the site as the availability of the films depends on what particular films the filmmakers have decided to make available to professionals. The availability is different for press and industry accreditation holders.  \n- Films are available for watching only after the first public screening has taken place in the cinema.   \n- The films are available only for a restricted period and you will see the info once the date is approaching.   \n- You can choose subtitles in the playback window, but please note that not all of the films have that option.  \n \n\n\n#### HOW TO SURVIVE?\_\n- Don’t overdo it. Our resident digital guru, Sten, says one hour in Zoom is like three hours in real life. Prioritise the events that are most important. You can always watch things later on catch up.\_\n- Take some breaks and leave your screen. You could block off some time in your meetings calendar and get some fresh air. Don’t know how it is with you, but Tallinn weather is nice for a brisk walk.\_\n- Try things out beforehand. We’d encourage you to see how our networking platform works and maybe join one of our earlier open events to get the hang of everything with no last-minute panic!\_"

        *Demystifying Virtual Reality* in collaboration with [Film New
        Europe](https://www.filmneweurope.com/) and [Proto Invention
        Factory](https://prototehas.ee/en/home/) is a hands-on workshop for
        filmmakers and enthusiasts, who are interested in what the future brings
        to the audiovisual medium.


        In 2019 *Demystifying Virtual Reality* took place in the Proto Invention
        Factory. The aim of the event was to increase the number of people and
        companies that could start creating various products using
        multidimensional audiovisual solutions (VR, AR, XR, etc.) in the future.
        Although the growing demand for VR competencies and services is growing
        in Estonia, the number of companies offering such services is less than
        five.


        Rein Zobel was the main mentor of the event. In addition to the projects
        and products developed by his company Maru VR, he is also a visiting
        lecturer of the VR lecture series at Tallinn University. In addition
        three more mentors attended the event in Talllinn and lifted the level
        of competence. Nimrod Shanit (Israel), Mitya Sorkin (Belarus) and Angel
        Urbina Vitoria (Spain) are all leading players in the field of creating
        virtual reality content in their respective countries.


        In addition to mentoring the workshop, all guests presented an hour-long
        case study, explaining their experiences and what opportunities they
        thought virtual reality offered in the future.


        Participants had access to a variety of 360-degree cameras, sound and
        lighting equipment, a post-production specialist, both mobile and
        computer compatible VR-headsets, and the whole Proto Invention Centre.
        The first day was mainly spent on the basics, theory, brainstorming, and
        forming groups. The second day began with a shooting period, followed by
        post-production, individual mentoring, and viewing the results with
        VR-headsets.

        The official selection of the Baltic Event Co-Production Market 2020,
        which runs on November 25-26, is more international than ever welcoming
        projects from Israel and the Philippines for the first time. As
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event has Russia in Focus this year, Russia is
        represented at the co-production market with five projects.  
    contents_en: >-
        Leana Jalukse, Co-Production Market Manager, said that despite the
        unexpectedly difficult year for the film industry and everyone in
        general, they were pleasantly surprised to receive the same amount of
        submissions as always with the quality rising ever higher. “We are
        thrilled to see that producers from high production capacity countries
        such as France and Germany are looking towards our territories for
        co-production opportunities. The themes, as always, come across the
        spectrum, and we are happy to support rising talent by showcasing a
        number of debut features – all by talented filmmakers who have won
        numerous awards for their short films,” she added. 


        *Aliya* from Israel by debut director Dekel Berenson follows the journey
        of a young Ukrainian woman of Jewish heritage training to become an
        instructor in the Israeli army. *Soldier*, another feature debut by the
        Finnish filmmaker Toni Kamula deals with the aftermath of moral dilemmas
        and blurred lines in war situations.  


        The lineup continues with two projects portraying difficulties faced by
        refugees – *Apathy*, France, by award-winning Greek filmmaker Alexandros
        Avranas, reveals the grim reality of a syndrome suffered by refugee
        children, while *Dogborn*, Sweden, the third debut by writer-director
        Isabella Carbonell features the impossible choice faced by two teenage
        refugees – smuggle children even younger than themselves or starve. 


        From Sweden, BE Co-Production Market also presents *Kevlar Soul*, a
        family drama dealing with addiction, by the short film team, director
        Maria Eriksson-Hecht and producer Ronnie Fritsche, Zentropa. Drugs are
        also the main subject of another family drama, *Class A from Ireland*,
        BE’s former focus country, by our fourth debutant Brian Durnin.


        Moving on to two dramas involving children, the first Filipino project,
        *Ninja from Manila*, is an adventure story of grief and acceptance by
        the experienced duo writer-director Miko Livelo and producer Alemberg
        Ang. *Milk Teeth*, a debut by Mihai Mincan from Romania, is a much
        darker story, involving the kidnapping and murder of a little girl.
        Another experienced team comes from Latvia – director Davis Simanis and
        producer Gints Grube present *Maria’s Silence*, their next historical
        drama based on true events.


        Lithuania’s project *Tasty* brings some lightness to our selection. Egle
        Vertelyte and Lukas Trimonis team up for their second feature, after
        participating in B’EST EAVE 2013 and going to screen their debut Miracle
        at over 50 festivals. 


        Baltic Event’s home country is this year represented by Oscar-nominated
        producer Ivo Felt’s next project *Eight Views of Lake Biwa* by director
        Marko Raat. The arthouse end of the spectrum is complemented by *Cold as
        Marble* from Azerbaijan, director Asif Rustamov backed by the French
        producer Guillaume de Seille, Arizona Productions. 


        Another East-West collaboration comes from established German producer
        Titus Kreyenberg, who has previously acted as a Eurimages Jury member –
        award-winning Turkish filmmaker Zeynep Dadak is developing *Electric
        Sleep*, a sci-fi film about a potential future.


        Three coming-of-age stories come to the slate by debut female directors
        backed by established producers – Us, 15 by Anna Buryachkova, Ukraine,
        *The Summer Ends Soon* by Yana Skopina and *The Land Named Sasha* by
        Yulia Trofimova, both Russia. 


        Russia in Focus also presents *White Road*, the second feature by Ella
        Manzheeva, who along with producer Elena Glikman developed her
        successful first film *The Gullsat* B’EST EAVE 2013; *At the End of the
        World*, another lyrical story from the far east region of Yakutia by
        award-winning director Eduard Novikov; *The Beilis Case*, an organised
        crime story by prolific filmmakers director Andrei Proshkin and
        screenwriter Yuri Arabov.


        The Eurimages Jury for BE Co-Production Market 2020 consists of:


        Elena Kotova, Eurimages representative, Czech Republic,


        Renata Santoro, Head of Programming, Giornate Degli Autori, Italy,

        #### Baltic Event Works in Progress showcases the good health of
        regional film industry  


        Baltic Event Works in Progress, taking place for the 18th time in 2020,
        showcases seven promising projects from the Baltics and Finland. 


        Maria Ulfsak, the Project Manager of Works in Progress Baltic Events
        said that they were happy that, even though the industry events are
        taking place online, there were still a lot of interesting projects
        applying to participate in Works in Progress programs. “The projects in
        the Baltic Event Works in Progress selection this year are very
        different, from a 3-million budget historical adventure film to smaller,
        edgier and more experimental projects. This shows the good health of the
        regional film industry – very different films are in production and
        post-production and even though the virus has affected us all, the
        future looks bright. Hopefully we can all meet in person in wintry
        Tallinn next year,” she added 


        This year, **Estonia** is represented with two projects at **Baltic
        Event Works in Progress**. Sports drama ***Kalev***, from director Ove
        Musting, tells the story of  Estonian national basketball team Kalev and
        their unpopular decision to take part of the USSR’s championships in the
        summer of 1990, with the Soviet Union on the verge of collapse. The
        mystical ***Melchior The Apothecary***, directed by Elmo Nüganen, takes
        place in medieval Tallinn, where Melchior Wakenstede, a clever and
        curious apothecary who, in addition to healing the sick, solves murders
        that shake the town.  


        Baltic Event Works in Progress also includes two projects from
        **Latvia** – the drama ***Lovable*** by director Stanislavs Tokalovs
        that unveils the story of Matiss and ten-year-old Stasija, who
        unexpectedly have lost their partner and mother. ***Neon Spring***, a
        new project by Matīss Kaža focuses on a 20-year old girl, Laine, who
        starts to question her sexuality and identity while her family is
        falling apart. 


        **Lithuania** is represented by two projects this year. A dramedy, ***I
        Am Fine, Thanks***, from Ernestas Jankauskas tells the story of a woman
        coming back to her former life after checking herself out of a
        rehabilitation clinic. A drama ***Feature Film About Life*** by Dovilė
        Šarutytė follows a story of a girl, Dovile, after her father’s death: as
        money is short, she decides to reject the professional funeral services
        and to organize the funeral herself.  


        In addition to projects from Baltics, **Finland** is presented with a
        drama ***A Girl’s Room*** by Aino Suni. The story unrolls as 17-year-old
        aspiring rapper Elina is forced to leave Finland and move to the South
        of France, where her mother’s boyfriend lives and where she soon meets
        her new stepsister Sofia. 


        #### International Works in Progress   


        The sixth International Works in Progress presents seven projects from
        all around the world.  


        Shahar Rozen from Israel presents fiction feature ***Ducks, Urban
        Legend***. Psychological drama ***The Anger***, directed and produced by
        Maria Ivanova Z is a joint project of Lebanon and Germany. Olesya
        Morgunets-Isaenko, from Ukraine, presents her first feature ***Carol of
        the Bells***. Representing the other side of the globe, Natalia Cabral
        and Oriol Estrada from the Dominican Republic showcase ***A Film About
        Couples***. 


        As in 2020 Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event introduces Russia in Focus,
        there are also three projects from Russia presented at International
        Works in Progress – dramas, including ***Nuuccha***, the first feature
        by director and screenwriter Vladimir Munkuev, another first feature – 
        ***First Snow*** by Nathalia Konchalovsky and  ***Zemun*** by Eduard
        Zholnin.  


        #### Just Film Works in Progress 


        For the second time, Works in Progress also presents projects in the
        children and youth film category. In 2020 there are four projects
        competing for the Just Film award – 1000 EUR to help the film gain
        visibility by covering promotion and publicity costs. 


        The jury of Just Film Works in Progress consists of Olaf Wehowsky
        (festival manager of LUCAS – International Festival for Young Film
        Lovers, Germany), Per Erikson (manager of the Swedish Federation of Film
        Societies, Sweden) and Guy Davies (film director /Philophobia/, UK)


        ***A Butterfly’s Heart*** is a feature from award-winning Lithuanian
        director Inesa Kurklietytė, who was named The International Film
        Festival Serseliafam’s  “Woman of the Year in Cinema”. Jaak Kilmi, a
        director from Estonia presents his newest project ***The Sleeping
        Beast***. A joint coproduction from Belgium, the Netherlands and France,
        ***This is My Moment*** is a creative documentary by Lieven Corthouts, a
        self-taught filmmaker focused on directing documentaries, and ***New

        TV Launch, an "idea-to-market" drama series project development program,
        is the only existing residential, project-based training targeting and
        tailoring its content for the creative teams of emerging professionals
        coming from the Central and Eastern European region and the only program
        of this kind working with both limited and ongoing series.
    contents_en: "Collaborating with a wide spectrum of tutors from both Western and Eastern Europe, who bring their expertise in the fields of writing, directing, producing, financing, marketing, pitching and distribution, the program offers a thorough and effective development process. It also helps the projects to be built in a “bottom-up” manner: from a very early development stage, the creative teams of writers and producers are led to defining their series concept and theme and outlining their pilot scripts, to creating their season arc and season outlines, as well as pitching documents and a financing strategy, to marketing and pitching their project and expanding their network. \n\nProjects developed within MIDPOINT TV Launch are presented at the most established professional industry platforms, accepted to the leading international TV markets and festival, commissioned and developed by significant European broadcasters and financiers and its graduates have proven to become an important element in both their local and the international audiovisual ecosystem.\n\nWith regard to the current coronavirus situation, the 2020 edition of MIDPOINT TV Launch transformed to a fully online training, spanning over 6 months. \n\n#### MIDPOINT TV Launch HBO Europe Award (5 000 USD)\n\nWinner: [Afterparty](https://industry.poff.ee/project/afterparty/) (Croatia)\nWriter: Dora Sustic\nProducer: Maja Pek-Bruenjes\n\nIn the words of Steve Matthews, who handed over the award on behalf of HBO Europe:\n“The difficulties of running the MIDPOINT programme online this year have certainly not resulted in any loss of quality: the participants all rose to the challenge with professionalism and innovation. As always this was a very difficult decision: several of the projects displayed extremely high levels of craft and attainment from teams who were collaborative and determined always to keep pushing themselves. But one stood out for having achieved those craft objectives, but which also displayed an additional spark of personal passion and the courage to explore difficult and controversial modern topics with great honesty. A writer’s job is to explore an issue, not to preach about it – and for that reason the winner of this years’ HBO Europe prize is AFTERPARTY.“\n\nMIDPOINT TV Launch is realized with the support of the Creative Europe – MEDIA Programme of the European Union, the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic, the Czech Film Fund and the Slovak Audiovisual Fund. It runs in partnership with HBO Europe, Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, Series Mania, Marseille Web Fest, Czech Audiovisual Producers' Association, Meeting Point Vilnius, New Europe Market, C21 Media, Serial Eyes, MediaXchange, MIA TV Market Rome and Seriencamp.

        At the European Genre Forum Packaging Lab in Tallinn, teams of seven
        genre films will take a deeper look at the marketing and sales of genre
        films. The projects will be guided by film professionals from Coffee &
        Cigarettes, Stray Dogs and ARRI Media. 

    contents_en: >+
        The case study will focus on the independent production *Jesus Shows You
        the Way to the Highway* by director Miguel Llanso. The film has already
        gained attention and positive feedback at several festivals for genre
        films.


        Miguel Llanso’s second feature *Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway*
        is an absurd sci-fi action-comedy. The project started as a no-budget
        film, and gradually grew into a co-production between Spain, Estonia,
        Ethiopia, Latvia and Romania. The film was partly financed via
        crowdfunding. The storyline introduces CIA Agents Palmer and Gagano, who
        are tasked with the mission of destroying a computer virus called
        “Soviet Union”. 


        Llanso, who is also employed as an associate professor at the Baltic
        Film, Media, Arts and Communication School, will focus on development
        and production with limited resources.


        The European Genre Forum (EGF) is an annual training programme that
        tries to boost the careers of future European players in the genre film
        industry. In 2019 EGF consists of two talent labs – The Producers Lab
        **in Zagreb** and The Packaging Lab **in Tallinn**. At the two-day
        Packaging Lab in Tallinn teams will focus on developing pitching skills,
        followed by public pitching at the Industry @ Tallinn & Baltic Event. 


        Every year, up to eight films will be selected by the European Genre
        Forum. The projects participating in this years’ programme include
        Lemnos (France), Utopya (Switzerland), Tracking: The Cyprus Tiger
        (Cyprus), Hospice (UK), Mirror of Nightingales (Croatia), Naked Coast
        (Poland) and Children of the Gods (Serbia). From previous editions of
        EGF, taking place for the third time, a Finnish project Hatching has
        reached the production stage and will be finished by 2021.  European
        Genre Forum is a pan-European project organised by [Black Nights Film
        Festival](https://2018.poff.ee/) from Tallinn; [Imagine Film
        Festival](http://www.imaginefilmfestival.com/) from Amsterdam and the
        [Fantastic Zagreb Film Festival](http://2018.fantastic-zagreb.com/).


        Tallinn Lab is supported by ARRI Media. The call for projects for 2020
        will open later in December.

        For the first time, Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event showcases five
        children and youth film projects in a newly launched Just FIlm Works in
        Progress category. The films in production or post-production looking
        for sales distributors, sound design, productions or festivals for
        international premieres will be presented at the Industry@Tallinn &
        Baltic Event Work in Progress sessions on November 26th.
    contents_en: >+
        According to Mikk Granström, Head of Just Film, the launch of **Just
        Film Works in Progress** focusing on film projects for children and
        youth is a logical step, as Just Film, a part of Black Nights Film
        Festival is expanding bit by bit every year. “We are delighted that our
        audience is more and more keen on youth and children’s films – the
        number of people attending the screenings is growing with each
        festival.” Granstrtöm also added that filmmakers are showing more
        interest in Just Film as they like to present their new films at our
        festival and the number of submissions increases every year. “After
        calling for proposals for Works in Progress for the children and youth
        films category we were positively surprised with the interest and amount
        of submissions we received,” he adds. 


        Just Film Works in Progress in Tallinn at the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic
        Event showcases five films: ***Family*** (Taiwan), ***Final Exam***
        (Kosovo), ***Unknown Treasures*** (Lithuania), ***Christmas in the
        Jungle and Raggie*** (Estonia). “While looking through the submissions,
        we focused on the films that might be especially engaging for kids and
        youth, but also for the whole family,” Granström commented on the
        selection.

        European Genre Forum and Haapsalu Horror and Fantasy Festival have
        teamed up to organise a global fireside chat called **“Fight or fright –
        how genre industry is facing the global lockdown”** with genre industry
        players to discuss what the genre industry could and should do to cope
        with the ongoing crisis.


        It comes as no surprise that the COVID19 epidemic has had a crushing
        impact on the global film circuit with a seemingly unstoppable wave of
        cancellations. The curfews have halted the whole lifecycle from
        production to festivals and markets, theatres, and digital releases
        alike and heated already strenuous relations between the studios,
        platforms, and theatres.


        With an estimated more than half a million industry members unemployed
        across the world, it is clear that the recovery for the film industry
        will be long and will require fresh blood and brains across the board.
        But how is the Genre industry doing which always has been the bad kid
        with “out of the box” mentality when it comes to content, financing,
        production, and squeezing the latest promotional or tech gimmicks to the
        max to gets the thrills to the viewers?


        With a few major festivals such as SXSW and Fantastia Festival down, but
        half of the genre’s A-listers such as Neuchatel and Bifan (South Korea)
        on its feet, and the viewers locked to their VOD offerings, could the
        genre circuit have a more robust change to emergence from the crisis as
        an unexpected winner?


        [European Genre Forum](https://europeangenreforum.com/) training
        programme and [Haapsalu Fantastic Film Festival](https://hoff.ee/en/)
        HOFF of the [Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival](https://poff.ee/en/)
        invite you to join the season’s first **digital deep dive into the state
        of the genre business to dissect how the industry is reacting to the
        COVID lockdown and what the community can do and is already doing to
        keep the blood rushing and the business kicking!**  Bringing together a
        festival director, a market runner financier, a duo of acclaimed
        independent producers and a sales agent, the digital Videodrome will see
        explore what will become of the festival and market circuit, has genre
        invaded the VOD and what to make or make not of the digital’s giants
        entry to the indie streaming landscape?

        18 projects will be presented at the  Co-Production Market 2019 taking
        place between November 26-29 during the Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event.
        The market’s 18th edition welcomes both promising debutants as well as
        industry heavyweights, with stories ranging from raw personal traumas to
        mind-bending thrillers.

    contents_en: >-
        “After opening our market to filmmakers from across the globe looking
        for a window to our region a few years ago, we are excited to admit that
        filmmakers from outside our traditional scope have finally found us,”
        Leana Jalukse, Co-Production Market Manager comments. “Our Focus
        Countries Ireland and Argentina are also bringing some winds of change,
        but, first and foremost, we’re proud to be showcasing some of the
        greatest talent from right next door – Central and Eastern Europe, and
        Scandinavia,” she adds.


        Baltic Event title countries, the Baltics, bring three debuts to the
        slate, each of which is following an award-winning short film of the
        director and is backed by an established production company – children’s
        film ***A Butterfly’s Heart*** by Inesa Kurklietyte, produced by Zivile
        Gallego of Fralita Films from Lithuania; ***Reconstruction*** by Evar
        Anvelt, with Laura Raud’s screenplay based on the novel by her father
        Rein Raud produced by Andreas Kask of Nafta Films, Estonia; and loosely
        autobiographical ***The Golden Spot*** by Liene Linde, produced by
        Guntis Trekteris of Ego Media, Latvia.


        Continuing on an autobiographical note, Polish coming-of-age story
        ***The Great Match*** by Filip Syczynski, backed by renowned producer
        Anna Rozalska of Match & Spark. Poland is also represented by a tough
        journey towards motherhood, ***The Seal Mother***, the second feature by
        Agnieszka Trzos, produced by award-winning Roman Jarosz of Holly
        Pictures.


        Moving on to Finland, Kaarle Aho (Black Ice, The Fencer) of Making
        Movies, whose numerous successful films have started out at Baltic Event
        over the years, brings to us ***The Good Driver***, the feature debut by
        award-winning documentary filmmaker Tonislav Hristov – the film will be
        a co-production with Bulgaria. Another co-production including Finland
        is ***Aria***, an intense love story by award-winning director Noud
        Heerkens, produced by Joram Willink of Bind, the Netherlands – with the
        third co-production party Belgium represented by the project’s
        screenwriter and DOP. Finland is also represented by the second feature
        by Miika Soini (*Thomas*), ***Never Enough White Roses***, a lyrical
        story dealing with the past, produced by Tiina Butter of Butterworks.


        Two projects have been selected from Russia. ***Babydoll*** is the
        feature debut by award-winning short film director and actor Elena
        Lanskih, backed by the experienced Natalia Drozd of CTB Film Company.
        The second Russian entry, ***The Conference***, by award-winning
        director Ivan I. Tverdovskiy (*Zoology, Corrections Class*), is based on
        a tragic true story, the terrorist attack in Moscow 17 years ago;
        Katerina Mikhaylova of Vega Film produces.


        True events have also inspired the political thriller ***The File***,
        the second feature by Jonas Karasek, brought to us by prominent producer
        Wanda Adamik Hrycova (*The Line*) of Wandal Production, Slovakia.


        Also represented by two debuts is Romania with ***Clara***, a portrait
        of the country’s recent exodus, by Sabin Dorohoi, produced by Daniel
        Burlac (*4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days*) of Western Transylvania Studios;
        and ***Horia***, a coming-of-age story by Ana Maria Comanescu, backed by
        Ada Solomon (*Scrarred Hearts, Aferim!*), microFILM, who has won over
        200 awards in her 20-something-year career.


        Our main slate is rounded up by two films treating the most complex of
        subjects –***The Exchange*** by debut director Sergo Ustyan tells the
        story of a prisoner exchange on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, Tigran
        Hambardzumyan of Persona Grata Group co-producing with Denmark, the UK,
        and Norway; and ***Sola***, following a man on a humanitarian mission,
        by award-winning Chadian film director Issa Serge Coelo (*Tartina City*)
        with the production helmed by Wilf Varvill, Fire Engine, UK, looking for
        co-producers from the Nordics.


        On to the Irish focus, which features ***July Fly***, a story about
        redemption by debutant Stevie Russell, a successful commercial and music
        video director, brought to us by producer Samantha Corr of Venom Films;
        and ***The Sparrow*** by Michael Kinirons, whose features as a writer
        have boasted A-list casts and his shorts have won numerous awards,
        presented by Alicia Ní Ghráinne of Tiger Darling Productions.


        Off to the other side of the world, for our Spotlight on Argentina,
        which has only just joined Eurimages. ***The Thaw***, a detective story
        in a hostile environment, is the debut for director Facundo Escudero
        Salinas, who already boasts an impressive resume, produced by Nicolás
        Münzel Camaño of Pensilvania Films. The film is intended as a
        co-production with Bolivia and Uruguay, but is also looking for European
        co-producers.

        How European talents in cinema, games and digital content will stay
        relevant with global competition increasing, how European startup
        innovators are championing new business models, and how Europe can lead
        the way in industry diversity actions? Those will be the three main
        topics on the agenda of the upcoming European Film Forum (EFF), the
        European Commission’s dialogue with stakeholders on Wednesday, 27
        November at the 23rd Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.


        Titled “Industry (R)evolution: Debating Tech, Distribution, and Future
        Talent for European Cinema,” the EFF will be a full-day executive-level
        public debate and showcase conference taking place at the
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event business arm of the A-class festival.
        The EFF will focus on the global developments that impact the
        audiovisual industry, from Artificial Intelligence to digital platforms,
        and will present new initiatives from the creative, diversity, and tech
        fields for the upcoming 2020+ term of Europe’s innovative programmes.

         As in previous editions, 19 international film, gaming, content, startups, and diversity leaders will be sharing the stage, including Sander Saar (Strategy and Growth Consultant for Red Bull Media House, formerly the Walt Disney Company), André Bernhardt (Managing Founder at Indieadvisory & Target Games), Helene Granqvist (President of Women in Film & TV International), Lindsay Peters (Executive Director at Frontières), producer Isabelle Glachant (Chinese Shadows), and film editor Isabelle Teitler whose work credits include Darren Aronofsky’s mother!. Norwegian documentary director Tonje Hessen Schei along with impact advocate Danielle Turkov Wilson will present and discuss the highly anticipated documentary iHuman providing insights into Artificial Intelligence and the opportunities and threats of this groundbreaking technology for Europe and beyond.

        The [European Film Forum
        (EFF)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-film-forum)
        was introduced by the European Commission in its 2014 Communication on
        European Film in the digital era. It is a platform for structured
        dialogue between policy makers and stakeholders in the audiovisual
        sector, travelling around European festivals and aiming to help develop
        a strategic policy agenda in the framework of the Digital Single Market.
        The EFF in Tallinn focuses on innovation between cinema, digital, and
        startup sectors and ties into Estonia’s position in digital leadership
        in the world. 


        Lucia Recalde, Head of MEDIA Unit, DG Connect, European Commission, said
        that the European audiovisual sector has a crucial role to play in our
        democracy and economy. “It is, however, undergoing a tremendous shift,
        being at the forefront of the digital, data and AI revolutions. The
        European Film Forum is, therefore, an event not to miss, as it is the
        place to debate how to scale up the European industry and how to further
        innovate and compete globally,” she added.


        Sten-Kristian Saluveer, Curator of EFFT19 commented that they are
        delighted to continue our partnership with the European Commission and
        host the European Film Forum in Tallinn again. “The global challenges
        facing creators and storytellers in cinema and other content industries
        are growing everywhere, and especially in the framework of the upcoming
        2020+ period of the MEDIA programme, events such as the Film Forum are
        indispensable to exchange best practices and to set bold innovation to
        motion for Europe’s content business,” he added.


        The full programme of the European Film Forum 2019 is available at

        Jonas Spokas and Kristofer Piir discuss how to attract big film and TV
        productions to Europe, including how to photograph locations, so they
        look attractive, and provide information to show they make sense for the
        production.

        In this year’s 8th instalment of Music Meets Film, primarily intended
        for composers and musicians aiming to create music for film, welcomes
        Peter Oxendale, forensic musicologist and copyright infringement
        specialist as one of the main speakers.


        In discussion with Tom Player, Oxendale lays out a film composer’s
        dilemma with a relationship to a film’s temporary score, and how the
        attachment to it (Temp Love) leads to wide-spread plagiarism. We will
        hear music excerpts illustrating composers’ interpretations of original
        music, which venture into the realm of copyright infringement.


        Peter Oxendale is an internationally-renowned musicologist, forensic
        musicologist and expert witness in copyright matters. He has written
        over 3,000 reports for use in copyright infringement cases across the
        globe, being trained as a Single Joint Expert. He has prepared reports
        for most of the major record companies and music publishers across the
        world. Beyond the realm of forensic musicology, Oxendale has a
        background in classical music and is a songwriter as well as composing
        advertising jingles and library music. He is also active as a producer,
        musical director and arranger and is also a session musician, conductor
        and a programmer. [Read more](https://www.oxendale-music.co.uk/)


        Music Meets Film 2019 will take place between November 25-27 across
        three locations – the Arvo Pärt Centre in Laulasmaa as well as the Music
        and Theater Academy and Forum Hotel in Tallinn.

        Does your festival have thousands of great photos in its archive waiting
        for the right time and opportunity to be used? How about finding out
        which filmmakers, sponsors, or partners attended certain events? Where
        were the most exciting photos taken, and on which occasions? Where are
        your sponsors' logos presented? Or do you want to give your festival
        photographers, marketing team, and audience a new tool to create great
        engagement videos automatically live from your event or the archive?
    contents_en: >-
        If this sounds familiar, then FotoInMotion could be the right solution
        for you.


        FotoInMotion is a three-year research project powered by the Horizon
        2020 program that has brought together four European technology
        companies, Intrasoft, the Athens Technology Center, INESC and QdepQ

        and three power players from Europe's creative business, including the
        acclaimed photo agency NOOR, leading Italian fashion and accessories
        brand MARNI, Paris-based journalism agency Worldcrunch and the Black
        Nights Film Festival.


        Over three years, the team has built a prototype for a mobile and
        desktop platform that turns single photographs into high-quality videos
        through utilizing machine learning and the latest research on artificial
        intelligence by understanding who or what is in the picture and how to
        build videos out of the platform automatically.


        The FotoInMotion desktop & mobile tool allows both creative content
        producers and the innovative public to efficiently produce high-quality
        videos from still photography, relying on AI-driven templates.
        Automatically annotated photos turned to videos can be easily shared on
        social media or taken to other platforms for further video editing.


        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event hosted a session looking into how
        FotoInMotion works, what kinds of solutions and experiences are
        available for you and your event, and how to utilize FotoInMotion
        AI-powered tools to take your creativity, production, or event to the
        next level.

        and TV productions to Europe, including how to photograph locations so
        they look attractive, and provide information to show they make sense
        for the production. We will do case studies on Christopher Nolan’s Tenet
        and HBO’s Chernobyl, looking at how the locations were first presented
        to their producers. The panel will be interesting for photographers,
        location scouts, production designers, line producers and other film
        professionals.

        On Tuesday join in the PÖFF Black Room workshop on brand identity by
        Karen K Burns, a co-founder and manager of Visory.ai, known for working
        on Hollywood A-Class films.

    contents_en: >-
        With the rise of self-marketing on social media, everyone can become
        their own brand. But, how do you stand out in this jungle of identities?
        What makes it even more challenging is that a good brand nowadays is
        about so much more than people just remembering your name. A good brand
        identity should communicate your entire essence, your history, your
        personal story, and values all at once.


        At the online seminar, she will talk about the basics of brand identity
        and trends in both marketing and presentation, bringing practical
        examples from both film and startup worlds.


        **Join the masterclass at 16:00 (EET)**

        Event, holds an insightful panel discussion with internationally
        recognised casting directors such as Joseph Middleton, Billy Hopkins and

    contents_en: >
        Claudia Landsberger, the head of PÖFF Black Nights Stars programme

        "We invited Lina Todd to do a panel with some of her colleagues and shed
        light on the matter. Joseph Middleton, Billy Hopkins, Avy Kaufman, Alice
        Whitley and Cynthia Campos-Greenberg, are all highly accomplished and
        major award-winning casting directors and talent managers with a wealth
        of experience working for Hollywood and independent productions, for big
        agencies such as ICM and William Morris Agency, and their own companies.
        It is a great honour for us to welcome these professionals to our online
        program, where they will meet the Black Nights Stars and share all that
        there is to know about this industry."  


        The panellists include casting director Joseph Middleton ("Mr. & Mrs.
        Smith", "Twilight: New Moon," "The Bourne Supremacy," "Legally Blonde",
        "The Single Man"), casting director Billy Hopkins "Desperately Seeking
        Susan", "The United States vs. Billie Holiday", "Mudbound"), casting
        director Avy Kaufman ("Life of Pi", "Lincoln", "Prometheus", "Shame",
        "Brokeback Mountain", "Capote", "The Sixth Sense", "Dancer in the
        Dark"), a NY-based talent agent Alice Whitley and a representative of
        talent in Hollywood, Cynthia Campos-Greenberg. The conversation is
        moderated by casting director Lina Todd of Lina Todd Casting, USA, "The
        Way Back" (Peter Weir); "Little Man Tate" (Jodie Foster); "A Good Day to
        Die Hard" (John Moore), "Crazy Alien" (Hao Ning).

        The first virtual Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event welcomes more than 800
        guests

    lead_en: >

        Today, the 19th edition of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, taking place
        virtually this year, kicks off with its online programme including over
        50 workshops, panels and seminars, hundreds of 1:1 meetings, and more
        than 800 accredited film industry professionals.  
    contents_en: >-
        According to Marge Liiske, Head of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, the
        record number of people interested in the event has pushed the team to
        put together an exhaustive programme with business, networking and
        learning elements. “2020 has forced also festivals and film markets to
        experiment and find new ways to operate. The models used until now are
        no longer effective, yet we still need to build fruitful business
        relationships, even if only online. In order to cope with changes,
        professionals need to have a good foresight about the future - what
        competencies and skills are needed, what kind of films to develop and
        produce, etc. Be informed, listen to the audiences, learn from your
        fellow professionals, analyse the course of history, and make it your
        own. And not only that - be kind, be attentive, connect with people - it
        is the key to the survival. We are giving only some of the tools that
        help you to move forward, as our colleagues from other film industry
        events have and will give theirs, so keep informed. ”  


        First and foremost, Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event continues to be a
        place to do business. The programme includes 76 projects are presented
        in eight different categories, including the works in progress, script
        competition, co-production market, and the ever-growing drama series
        part, with public pitchings and/or one-to-one meetings. Also, accredited
        guests have access to the networking platform that allows them to get
        together with other attendees virtually.  


        As Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event has [Russia in Focus in
        2020](https://industry.poff.ee/virtual-booth-en/panels-and-presentations/)
        (in collaboration with ROSKINO), participants will have the opportunity
        to find out more about projects, companies and the regional business
        environment. As the Black Nights Film Festival’s focus country is
        Germany, there will be opportunities to learn from some outstanding
        German film and series writers, in association with German Films. Also,
        20 selected European Producers on the move will be attending the
        online-summit. 


        Learning something new has also always been a cornerstone of
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event and 2020 is no different. The intensive
        programme will kick off with [European Film Forum
        Tallinn](https://industry.poff.ee/about/european-film-forum-tallinn-2020/)
        zooming into leadership resilience, foresight and transformation of the
        film industry during COVID19. The half-day virtual conference will
        present 11 international film and media industry professionals sharing
        their experiences and insights on the most pressing topics for the
        European film, television and content industry.  


        [Music Meets Film](https://industry.poff.ee/about/music-meets-film/)
        takes place for the 9th time and brings together industry professionals
        sharing their insights on current trends in film scoring and how the
        film music industry operates, through discussions with four-time Oscar
        nominee Danny Elfman, Gavin Greenaway and Andrey A. Tarkovsky.  [The
        Black Nights Stars](https://industry.poff.ee/about/black-night-stars/)
        programme supports young actors from the Baltic Sea region, to make
        their next steps into the international arena and offers various open
        events throughout the week including a panel discussion with US casting
        directors about how to “make it” in the US, led by Lina Todd, and
        webinar about intimacy in front of the camera by Julia Effertz. 


        The extensive week will end with the two-day drama series programme [TV
        Beats](https://industry.poff.ee/about/tv-beats-forum/), taking place for
        the 3rd year in a row, that focuses on the challenges of production in
        the COVID era, as well as on gender equality in the industry. The
        programme includes several case studies providing know-how about
        international co-productions including the Netflix hit series Stanger
        Things; Ukrainian global crime thriller Hide and Seek and forthcoming
        series There Will Be People; and Russian thriller Dead Mountain –The
        Dyatlov Pass Incident, as well as brand new Estonian crime series In the
        Line of Fire. 


        In addition, there are workshops and masterclasses on how to approach
        international streamers, maximize the potential of a project through
        well-targeted packaging, develop new short formats like web series,
        write your new VR story, and much more. 


        “We know it can be very tiring to be in front of a screen all day and
        that online fatigue drains our energy. Therefore, most of the panels and
        workshops will be also accessible to accredited guests for several weeks
        after the event as catchup, so everyone can find the time to hear the
        discussions and let them sink in, before starting the next “chapter”,”
        Liiske adds. 


        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event, one of the largest film events in
        Northern Europe, takes place from the 23rd to 27th of November 2020.
        Online by design, the virtual events, as well as the schedule, are
        accessible at industry.poff.ee.

        The COVID19 outbreak has severely hit the audiovisual industry, with
        some estimates projecting losses up to EUR 24 billion in the next five
        years. Yet, despite the dramatic recession, a new-generation industry
        and business leadership is emerging to steer the cinema sector out of
        the crisis through actions of resilience, foresight and transformation
        of organisations, formats and business practices.  
    contents_en: >-
        The European Film Forum (EFF) will return to the Tallinn Black Nights
        Film Festival on 23 November for a half day of high-level debates and
        case studies focusing on how the industry can best overcome its
        challenges. The conference will address questions such as why and how to
        rebuild the broken value chain between creators, producers, sales and
        audiences. In addition, it will look at the new data driven playbook for
        European film and content marketing, and will showcase a new initiative
        to launch globally the Europe-built copyright infrastructure.  


        Furthermore, Adrian Wooton (CEO of Film London) will present the results
        of the largest industry consultation done by his organisation with the
        aim of resuming film productions in the city. The directors of the
        International Film Festival Rotterdam, the Udine Far East Film Festival,
        and the New Horizons Polish Days will explain how their events persisted
        during the crisis and will highlight the best strategies and actions to
        ensure the success of future festivals. Then, Robert Wolcott (a
        worldwide acclaimed innovation scientist and founder of Twin - formerly
        Kellogg Innovation network) will discuss in conversation with Sten
        Saluveer (EFFT curator) the basis of his work with political and Fortune
        500 leaders across the globe, as well as the skills and actions required
        for the post-COVID era. Finally, the European Commission will present
        the novelties of the upcoming Creative Europe MEDIA programme, running
        from 2021 to 2027.  

         “The European Commission, via the new Creative Europe MEDIA programme and other supporting actions, will help the audiovisual ecosystem throughout the crisis and beyond to become more resilient and globally competitive. We will support the sector to recover (by compensating the losses and providing liquidity), to transform (by investing in a green, sustainable, digital and resilient industry) and to feel empower (by allowing more innovation and greater content access),” says Lucia Recalde, Head of Creative Europe MEDIA at the European Commission.   

        “The dramatic shifts in the global film industry have not come as a full
        shock as they have been here for a long time. That said, they were
        drastically accelerated by COVID19 which also added a long-term impact.
        Thus it is clear that this new reality will require not only financial
        but also new leadership skills and resources for the industry to
        revitalise. Thanks to our long-term collaboration with the European
        Commission, we have now the opportunity to bring this very timely and
        pressing topic to the forefront of this year's EFFT at the Black Nights
        Film Festival,” adds Sten-Kristian Saluveer, European Film Forum Tallinn
        Curator.  


        As in previous editions, 11 international film and media industry
        leaders and policymakers will be sharing the (virtual) stage, including
        Lucia Recalde (Head of MEDIA Unit, European Commission), Ezra Eeman 
        (Senior Manager Digital, EBU), Tine Klint (CEO, Level K), Ewa
        Puszczyńska (Producer, Extreme Emotions), Todd Brown (Partner, XYZ
        Films), Birgit Karus (CEO, Noh Productions), Vanja Kaludjercic (Festival
        Director, IFFR), Sabrina Baracetti (Festival Director, Udine Far East
        FF), Weronika Czolnowska (New Horizons, Head of Industry), Adrian Wooton
        (Head, Film London), Philippe Rixhon (Infrastructure Designer, European
        Future Copyright Infrastructure) and Robert Wolcott (Co-Founder and
        Executive Director, Kellogg Innovation Network). 
         
        The European Film Forum in Tallinn will take place online and the live
        stream will be accessible to everyone at [industry.poff.ee](
        industry.poff.ee). The full programme of the EFF is already available at
        [https://www.europeanfilmforumtallinn.online/](europeanfilmforumtallinn.online)  


        The European Film Forum (EFF) was introduced by the European Commission
        in its 2014 Communication on European Film in the digital era, as a
        debate and discussion platform on the future evolution of European
        cinema and film industry. The EFF in Tallinn focuses on innovation
        between cinema, digital and the start-up sectors, and ties into
        Estonia’s position in digital leadership in the world.

        The year 2020 brought many innovations to Industry@Tallinn along with
        new developments of the program. Among them was [PÖFF Black
        Room](https://industry.poff.ee/about/black-room/) which dives into the
        wonders of cinema’s visual language. The program is dedicated to Art
        Department and sets out to deepen the knowledge about the unique craft
        that combines art, design, architecture and a lot of intrepid
        creativity.
    contents_en: >+
        PÖFF Black Room’s program is created both for film enthusiasts and
        professionals. One week full of masterclasses and workshops opened a
        fascinating perspective to filmmaking through production design. The
        program was created in collaboration with  [European Film
        Academy](https://www.europeanfilmacademy.org) which brought together
        world-renowned masters of the Art Department as PÖFF Black Room
        mentors.

        and Jacqueline Abrahams.


        The first program was led by award-winning production designers
        Jacqueline Abrahams [Jacqueline
        Abrahams](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009008/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) and

        and the grandmaster of miniature models [Simon
        Weisse](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919232/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Each of
        the three mentors gave a virtual masterclass to accredited attendants of
        Industry@Tallinn and carried out workshops for the selected six
        production designers. The program also included a unique panel [„Lost in
        translation? Visual story development from script to
        screen”](https://content.jwplatform.com/players/8pDkTeNZ-plsZnDJi.html)
        by Variety and masterclass of brand identity for independent filmmakers.


        The selected participants of PÖFF Black Room’s training program valued
        most „the interactiveness and „the thoroughness of the workshop and the
        level of expertise of the mentors.” The training program is created for
        experienced production designers who attended the workshops as seminars
        where everybody is expected to add to the discussions. The six selected
        production designers were from Germany, Romania and Estonia. In 2021 the
        training program will be held the Estonian Academy of Arts.

        On Friday, 27 November, you are welcomed to join a practical online
        workshop aimed to film writers, narrative designers, and dramaturgs
        interested in Virtual Reality who have little or no experience with the
        medium. During the 3-hour workshop “Writing for Virtual Reality"
        participants, who are asked to pre-register, learn the challenges of
        writing for cinematic virtual reality and develop a 1-page script. 
    contents_en: >-
        The workshop aims to generate more awareness about the possibilities of
        the medium and to increase the number of screenwriters that are
        interested in creating stories for 360° media including VR, XR, and AR
        in the future. Although immersive media traces back to the last century,
        there is little practical literature for writers interested in
        participating in this medium. In addition to their 1-page, participants
        will be requested to participate in several practical activities
        designed to sensibilize them to the challenges of virtual reality,
        including POV, cues, and technological limitations. 


        Ana Falcon will moderate the event, and it is created as part of her
        current research in Virtual Reality screenwriting methodologies. Falcon
        was selected for the 2008 Fusion Arts Exchange in Screenwriting and Film
        Production hosted by the University of Southern California and the US
        State Department. In 2017, she was distinguished with a Young Creators
        FONCA grant from the Mexican Culture Ministry. In 2019, she was a
        screenwriting finalist in the Watersprite International Student Film
        Festival hosted by the University of Cambridge. 


        To join the event, please register via email info.industry@poff.ee by
        Wednesday 25th of November.

        Cineuropa and AGICI have been working together for the past 3 years
        bringing delegations of Italian producers to foreign industry events
        with an eye to supporting international co-productions and forging solid
        connections with like-minded producers abroad. Producers taking part in
        the delegation are selected on the basis of individual projects aimed at
        co-productions with a specific territory or territories. We have worked
        with the Seville European Festival for two years with projects resulting
        in successful co-productions between Italy and Spain. This year we are
        working with Tallinn Black Nights Festival and focusing on projects
        aimed at co-productions between Italy and the Baltic or Scandinavian
        countries (as well as bordering territories). We are also working in
        co-operation with the Italian Ministry of Culture, which is launching
        for the third consecutive year, the co-development fund between Italy
        and the Baltic countries. The 5 projects selected for participation in
        the dedicated event “Italy goes Baltic” range from precise location
        needs in the Baltics to more open collaborations with international
        producers and also offer diverse genres and formats.

        Russia opens up new cooperation opportunities at the Industry@Tallinn &

        For the very first time, the Russian presence at one of the largest
        European venues for audiovisual content will be super ambitious and on a
        grand scale.  Under the RUSSIA IN FOCUS brand, the talented directors,
        actors, and producers, will present their projects in a number of the
        forum’s sections.
    contents_en: >

        RUSSIA IN FOCUS is a global presentation of Russian audiovisual content,
        film projects and creative talents at one of the key international
        co-production markets and producer's platforms, designed to build strong
        ties between Russian and international creative industry players.
        Supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation and
        ROSKINO, the organization in charge of promoting Russian content
        worldwide, the Russian creative industries presents a variety of genres,
        styles, stories and a host of new names to the international
        professional audience. 


        "We are glad to start cooperation with one of the largest European film
        industry summits not only at the projects level but at the
        organizational level because the Baltic region is one of the key markets
        for Russian content; Estonia and Latvia are in the top 10 foreign
        markets, by box office, for Russian films abroad," says Evgenia Markova,
        ROSKINO CEO. 


        She adds that Russia has been represented at the Industry @ Tallinn &
        Baltic Event before, but this year they are participating in a large
        number of events: sections & panel discussions. Each of these events
        highlights Russia’s potential in different ways. "For example, in the
        Co-Production Market we will show a range of projects that can be
        internationally successful thanks to their universality. Of particular
        importance, here we will also present the projects from the participants
        of the international educational program in coproduction, EAVE ON DEMAND
        IN RUSSIA, initiated by ROSKINO and supported by the Ministry of Culture
        of the Russian Federation. This is a case in point of how educational
        projects have helped young Russian producers find their way on to the
        international markets. Another important thing of note is the
        participation of young Russian actors in the Black Nights Stars. It is
        especially important to increase the awareness of Russian talents to the
        wider audience abroad, and the first steps will be taken here at this
        event through meeting B2B partners, sales agents, etc. All in all,
        RUSSIA IN FOCUS is a great chance to explore the new emerging
        opportunities in Russia," Markova comments.


        #### Focus on Co-Production


        Special focus will be put on the Baltic Event Co-Production Market
        section, where five Russian projects will be presented to potential
        co-production partners. Two of them – *The Beilis Case* and *The Land
        Named Sasha* - will be introduced by the participants of the EAVE ON
        DEMAND IN RUSSIA program. Producers Marina Naumova (*The Beilis Case*)
        and Katerina Mikhailova (*The Land Named Sasha*) will use this
        opportunity to bring their projects to the international platform after
        they completed their EAVE practice with international experts.


        Co-production is the new focus of the Russian content industry - it
        facilitates the promotion on the world’s markets, accumulates
        international experience and contributes to the creative industry sector
        of all countries involved in the co-production process. The great
        potential of the Russian film industry in the field of co-production was
        been proven with the many successful projects in recent years. These
        include *Conference* by Ivan Tverdovsky (Russia, Estonia, Great Britain,
        Italy), which was included in the short list of the Giornate degli
        Autori section of the 77th Venice Film Festival;  *The Whale Boy* by
        Philip Yuriev (Russia, Poland, Belgium) which received the Director’s
        Award in the Giornate degli Autori section of the 77th Venice Film
        Festival; *Persian Lessons* by Vadim Perelman (Russia, Germany,
        Belarus), presented at the 70th anniversary Berlin Film Festival and
        many others.


        Despite the unprecedented circumstances and multiple closed borders,
        quite a number of co-pro projects are still in progress right now. Among
        the current co-production partners of Russia are Canada, Germany,
        France, Switzerland, Great Britain, Mexico and Ireland. Also, earlier in
        October 2020, Eurimages (European cultural support fund of the Council
        of Europe), announced it would give subsidies to several Russian
        co-production projects with Slovenia, Turkey, Germany, and France. One
        such project is *Captain Volkonogov Escaped* by Natalya Merkulova and
        Alexey Chupov in co-production with Estonia and France.


        One of the most important events of the forum under the RUSSIA IN FOCUS
        brand, will be a number of special panels and discussions devoted to
        co-production opportunities.  In particular, the rebate system and
        subsidy models will form the core of the round table discussion
        **Filming opportunities and financial initiatives in Russian
        NorthWest**. Today, the Northwestern regions of Russia such as
        Kaliningrad, Karelia, Murmansk, and Novgorod regions, offer not only
        amazing shooting locations with beautiful landscapes close to European
        borders but also financial support to foreign film producers.


        Another important point of focus will be put on co-production
        opportunities with Scandinavian producers during the round table 

        **Adaptation vs. Co-production:  Russian - Scandinavian case. Producers
        and showrunners of Russian TV series** – adaptations of internationally
        acclaimed Scandi Noir series, and Russian TV series acclaimed abroad,
        will discuss the most efficient possibilities for cross-country
        collaborations.


        Russian talents and projects will also be presented in the TV Beats
        Forum, Works in Progress section, POWR Baltic Stories Exchange and the
        Black Nights Stars programs.

    lead_en: >-
        The first online Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event saw over 35 000 virtual
        attendances, resulting from a record 1600 accredited professionals
        across industry events and the film festival. The number plays a
        significant part in setting a record also for Tallinn Black Nights Film
        Festival, with an estimated 101 833 physical and virtual attendances
        this year.  
    contents_en: >-
        As anticipated by the festival’s team, the ticket sales saw a notable
        drop this year with over 34 000 physical attendances and an estimated 19
        000 virtual film viewings*, compared to last year’s 70 000 physical
        cinema attendances. The festival’s professionals’ film-watching platform
        had 9779 viewings. 


        A major shift took place with the virtual event attendances as
        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event had close to 900 virtual accreditations
        from 60 countries – both numbers have set a record for the summit. The
        programme of Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event 2020, online by design,
        included 62 events and several of them were available online without
        accreditation as well, including its most popular event – the European
        Film Forum Tallinn.  


        Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event director Marge Liiske commented: “Having
        organised a record attendance numbers' virtual industry event over five
        consecutive days in three parallel broadcasting channels, project
        presentations and meetings, showed us the potential of online in the
        future. We also feel grateful for the industry professionals having such
        a strong sense of community and a powerful will of collaboration. I hope
        to meet and thank you all in person in 2021!” 


        “We welcomed a record number of 76 projects at this year’s edition. As
        online pitching and networking is something the whole industry is just
        getting used to, we and the juries were positively surprised how
        professionally the projects were presented and how eagerly industry
        professionals took part of the online meeting possibilities,” Liiske
        added.  


        Organising online industry events is much like learning by doing and
        could only be possible thanks to the smooth collaboration between the
        team, mentors and experts, participants, as well as to the generosity of
        supporters and partners. “We are very grateful for our sponsors Elisa,
        Roskino and Tallinn City - and supporters including German Films,
        Estonian, Finnish and Lithuanian Film Institutes, Cultural Endowment of
        Estonia, who’s co-operation and effort has allowed us to create our
        online summit discussing the most urgent topics in the film industry. It
        would have been so much more challenges, if not impossible, without
        them,” she commented. Industry@Tallinn & Baltic Event is co-funded by
        the Creative Europe Media Programme of the European Union. The European
        Film Forum Tallinn is organised by the European Commission’s mandate

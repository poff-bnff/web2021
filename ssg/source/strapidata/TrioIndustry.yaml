                    **The New Playbook: Resilience, Foresight, Transformation**


                    **Time**: November 23, 2020 16.00 – 19.00 EEST / 15.00 –
                    18.00 CET


                    **Venue**: Online at https://industry.poff.ee/


                    [Watch European Film Forum Tallinn 2020 as catchup
                    here](https://poff.elisastage.ee/landing/bc/mZ1D2CpUpk/oXu2e2hmD74)


                    The year 2020 has been like no other before for the European
                    and the global film industry. The explosive shock,
                    unprecedented in its breadth and impact, has not only
                    imploded the full value chain of cinema but has brought to
                    the forefront the most significant challenges the medium and
                    the industry has faced since its birth – whichever angle one
                    takes.


                    The European independent sector has witnessed perhaps the
                    hardest, with all but a few significant festivals canceled,
                    productions suspended, and distribution chains are broken
                    with cinemas and audiences coping with on the national
                    lockdown fronts.


                    From a global perspective, perhaps 2020 has been the best
                    year ever for watching, with accounts showing a tremendous
                    spike in the consumption of audiovisual content and a
                    staggering 79% increase in streaming hours, leading some of
                    the super players to gap the quality of their services.


                    As paradoxical it might seem, the global COVID epidemic has
                    not derailed the film industry by surprise as many would
                    love to believe, but savagely accelerated the already
                    current transformation processes. For a fact, few players
                    emerging with the bounty while many are jogging dazedly
                    behind.


                    Thus, the new playbook for a new normal is here – the
                    question is how to define opportunities, strategies, and
                    best practices and transform fast with foresight and
                    resilience before it’s too late.


                    The European Film Forum, as a debate and discussion platform
                    on the future evolution of European cinema and film
                    industry, will return to Tallinn on November 23, 2020, with
                    a half a day virtual and hybrid summit of executive-level
                    debates, case studies, and showcases on the most pressing
                    topics for the European film, television, and content
                    industry at the time of COVID.

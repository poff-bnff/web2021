                    1.12 Technical requirements and guidelines for film formats


                    The accepted screening format for all films in competition
                    and non-competition sections is DCP. Provided DCPs must be
                    DCI compliant (http://www.dcimovies.com/) and adhere to all
                    applicable conditions below.


                    DCPs must be provided and shipped on industry standard and
                    protected hard drives or delivered digitally with previous
                    confirmation from the festival technical department.
                    Consumer grade hard drives and memory sticks are not
                    permitted.


                    Video formats and 35mm prints are accepted only with prior
                    acknowledgement from the festival. All video files will be
                    converted into DCPs by the festival appointed lab to ensure
                    the best possible image and sound quality during playback.


                    Tapes or Blu-rays are not accepted as screening formats,
                    unless there are no alternatives and with prior
                    acknowledgment from the festival.


                    All films selected for the festival must be provided with
                    English subtitles, unless they are already in English. All
                    the films from the Official Selection Competition and First
                    Feature Competition, as well as a selection of films from
                    other sections are translated into Estonian.


                    The festival prefers to transfer local subtitles onto DCPs
                    for ensuring the best possible screening experience. For
                    that purpose DCPs must meet the following requirements:
                    provided screening DCPs must be unencrypted, or with DKDM
                    for festival lab, as original language versions (OV) with
                    separate accompanying subtitles as version-file packages
                    (VF). DCPs with burned in subtitles are not accepted in this
                    case.


                    If the transfer of translated subtitles onto the DCP is not
                    agreed with the representative of the film, the translations
                    will be shown electronically.


                    All screening copies for all sections, if provided with any
                    subtitles, must have the subtitles on the active picture
                    area and not in the letterbox area. Dubbed language copies
                    are also refused.


                    The festival reserves the right to demand new DCP packages
                    free of charge in case of non-compatible DCPs, files are on
                    broken hard drives or other quality standards are not met.
                    These include wrongly placed or missing subtitles, or wrong
                    soundtracks.


                    Unencrypted DCPs are strongly preferred. In case of
                    encrypted DCPs, the festival requires one test KDM per film
                    free of charge for quality assurance and technical testing
                    for our test-screen or DKDM for laboratory testing. The
                    quality assurance purpose KDM or DKDM is requested to be
                    valid from the date the DCP arrives at the festival till 2
                    days after the festival.


                    The producer or film representative is requested to provide
                    appropriate screening KDMs valid from 3 days before the
                    start of the festival and 2 days after the festival, but in
                    minimum at least 72 hours prior to screenings, and 48 hours
                    after the screening. The cost of generating all KDMs will
                    also be the responsibility of the producers or
                    representatives of the film.


                    If the festival is provided with broken or wrongly assigned
                    KDMs, appropriate new KDMs must be provided free of charge
                    by the film submitter or representative. Quality assurance
                    purpose DKDM does not exempt from providing screening KDMs
                    if not agreed upon otherwise.


                    The festival supports 2K and 4K content. However, not all
                    screens have a 4K projecting capability. The festival
                    therefore cannot guarantee that all 4K films will be
                    screened in a 4K resolution.


                    We can accept high-frame-rate DCPs (HFR), however we are

                    applicant no later than 1st of October 2020.


                    The applicant agrees that confirmed titles may not be
                    withdrawn from the festival programme after its
                    participation has been officially confirmed and the producer
                    or producer’s authorised representative has verified the

                    competitive or non-competitive sections the applicant agrees
                    to:

                    physical format, as well as via file sharing programs or
                    services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box etc.


                    2.4 Technical requirements and guidelines for film formats


                    The accepted screening format for all films in competition
                    and non-competition sections is DCP. Provided DCPs must be
                    DCI compliant (www.dcimovies.com) and adhere to all
                    applicable conditions below.


                    DCPs must be provided and shipped on industry standard and
                    protected hard drives or delivered digitally with previous
                    confirmation from the festival technical department.
                    Consumer grade hard drives and memory sticks are not
                    permitted.


                    All films selected for the festival must be provided with
                    English subtitles, unless they are already in English. A
                    selection will be translated into Estonian. If the transfer
                    of translated subtitles onto the DCP is not agreed with the
                    representative of the film, the translations will be shown
                    electronically.


                    All screening copies for all sections, if provided with any
                    subtitles, must have the subtitles on the active picture
                    area and not in the letterbox area. Dubbed language copies
                    are also refused.


                    The festival reserves the right to demand new DCP packages
                    free of charge in case of non-compatible DCPs, files are on
                    broken hard drives or other quality standards are not met.
                    These include wrongly placed or missing subtitles, or wrong
                    soundtracks.


                    Unencrypted DCPs are strongly preferred. In case of
                    encrypted DCPs, the festival requires one test KDM per film
                    free of charge for quality assurance and technical testing
                    for our test-screen or DKDM for laboratory testing. The
                    quality assurance purpose KDM or DKDM is requested to be
                    valid from the date the DCP arrives at the festival till 2
                    days after the festival.


                    The producer or film representative is requested to provide
                    appropriate screening KDMs valid from 3 days before the
                    start of the festival and 2 days after the festival, but in
                    minimum at least 72 hours prior to screenings, and 48 hours
                    after the screening. The cost of generating all KDMs will
                    also be the responsibility of the producers or
                    representatives of the film.


                    If the festival is provided with broken or wrongly assigned
                    KDMs, appropriate new KDMs must be provided free of charge
                    by the film submitter or representative. Quality assurance
                    purpose DKDM does not exempt from providing screening KDMs
                    if not agreed upon otherwise.


                    The festival supports 2K and 4K content. However, not all
                    screens have a 4K projecting capability. The festival
                    therefore cannot guarantee that all 4K films will be
                    screened in a 4K resolution.


                    The festival reserves the right to refuse and withdraw the
                    screening of the film from the competition or any other
                    section if all requirements are not followed.


                    Detailed technical guidelines will be available linked for
                    download along with the festival regulations on the festival
                    website from 1st of June 2020 and also provided along with
                    confirmation entry form.


                    Our festival’s technical team, dcinema@poff.ee, will happily
                    help with any queries for all confirmed films.

                    All costs related to the shipping of the screener copy (DVD)

                    broken hard drives are refused and the festival has the
                    right to demand new copies (as well as KDMs) free of charge
                    for damaged and non-working DCP packages.


                    Please note that:


                    The Festival supports 2K and 4K content in all screens.
                    However, not all screens have a 4K projector. The Festival
                    cannot guarantee that a 4K film will be screened in a 4K
                    resolution.

                    All screens support both Flat and Scope content.

                    The Festival requires all DCP’s to be in XYZ color space
                    encoded in JPEG2000.

                    English subtitle tracks at least 72 hours prior to
                    screenings. If the festival is provided with broken or
                    wrongly assigned KDM’s, appropriate new KDM’s must be
                    provided free of charge by the film submitter or
                    representative to meet the minimum Festival requirements.


                    The festival reserves the right to demand screening copies
                    of competition films free of charge including alternative
                    keys to DCP copies or new DCP packages if quality standards
                    are not being met. These include missing subtitles or wrong
                    soundtracks. Thus, the festival has the right to refuse and
                    withdraw the screening of a film in the competitions if the
                    above-mentioned guidelines are not being followed.


                    All other formats must be confirmed by the festival
                    technical team.


                    3.4 Delivery of materials


                    Screening copies should be delivered electronically via

                    environment or can provide its own upload environment. All
                    technical questions and information regarding file formats,
                    DCP’s and upload should be sent to dcinema@poff.ee.

                    the Festival by the date set in regulations or by the date
                    agreed with the festival beforehand, The Festival Director

                    1.12 Technical requirements and guidelines for film formats


                    The accepted screening format for all films in competition
                    and non-competition sections is DCP. Provided DCPs must be
                    DCI compliant (http://www.dcimovies.com/) and adhere to all
                    applicable conditions below.


                    DCPs must be provided and shipped on industry standard and
                    protected hard drives or delivered digitally with previous
                    confirmation from the festival technical department.
                    Consumer grade hard drives and memory sticks are not
                    permitted.


                    Video formats and 35mm prints are accepted only with prior
                    acknowledgement from the festival. All video files will be
                    converted into DCPs by the festival appointed lab to ensure
                    the best possible image and sound quality during playback.


                    Tapes or Blu-rays are not accepted as screening formats,
                    unless there are no alternatives and with prior
                    acknowledgment from the festival.


                    All films selected for the festival must be provided with
                    English subtitles, unless they are already in English. All
                    the films from the Official Selection Competition and First
                    Feature Competition, as well as a selection of films from
                    other sections are translated into Estonian.


                    The festival prefers to transfer local subtitles onto DCPs
                    for ensuring the best possible screening experience. For
                    that purpose DCPs must meet the following requirements:
                    provided screening DCPs must be unencrypted, or with DKDM
                    for festival lab, as original language versions (OV) with
                    separate accompanying subtitles as version-file packages
                    (VF). DCPs with burned in subtitles are not accepted in this
                    case.


                    If the transfer of translated subtitles onto the DCP is not
                    agreed with the representative of the film, the translations
                    will be shown electronically.


                    All screening copies for all sections, if provided with any
                    subtitles, must have the subtitles on the active picture
                    area and not in the letterbox area. Dubbed language copies
                    are also refused.


                    The festival reserves the right to demand new DCP packages
                    free of charge in case of non-compatible DCPs, files are on
                    broken hard drives or other quality standards are not met.
                    These include wrongly placed or missing subtitles, or wrong
                    soundtracks.


                    Unencrypted DCPs are strongly preferred. In case of
                    encrypted DCPs, the festival requires one test KDM per film
                    free of charge for quality assurance and technical testing
                    for our test-screen or DKDM for laboratory testing. The
                    quality assurance purpose KDM or DKDM is requested to be
                    valid from the date the DCP arrives at the festival till 2
                    days after the festival.


                    The producer or film representative is requested to provide
                    appropriate screening KDMs valid from 3 days before the
                    start of the festival and 2 days after the festival, but in
                    minimum at least 72 hours prior to screenings, and 48 hours
                    after the screening. The cost of generating all KDMs will
                    also be the responsibility of the producers or
                    representatives of the film.


                    If the festival is provided with broken or wrongly assigned
                    KDMs, appropriate new KDMs must be provided free of charge
                    by the film submitter or representative. Quality assurance
                    purpose DKDM does not exempt from providing screening KDMs
                    if not agreed upon otherwise.


                    The festival supports 2K and 4K content. However, not all
                    screens have a 4K projecting capability. The festival
                    therefore cannot guarantee that all 4K films will be
                    screened in a 4K resolution.


                    We can accept high-frame-rate DCPs (HFR), however we are
                    only able to screen them in selected cinema halls. Please
                    notify the festival office if you are planning on presenting
                    a high-frame-rate DCP.


                    The festival reserves the right to refuse and withdraw the
                    screening of the film from the competition or any other
                    section if all requirements are not followed.


                    Detailed technical guidelines will be available linked for
                    download along with the festival regulations on the festival
                    website from 1st of June 2020 and also provided along with
                    confirmation entry form.


                    Our festival’s technical team, dcinema@poff.ee, will happily
                    help with any queries for all confirmed films.

                    The applicant agrees that confirmed titles may not be
                    withdrawn from the festival programme after its

                    services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box etc.


                    2.4 Technical requirements and guidelines for film formats


                    The accepted screening format for all films in competition
                    and non-competition sections is DCP. Provided DCPs must be
                    DCI compliant (www.dcimovies.com) and adhere to all
                    applicable conditions below.


                    DCPs must be provided and shipped on industry standard and
                    protected hard drives or delivered digitally with previous
                    confirmation from the festival technical department.

                    All films selected for the festival must be provided with
                    English subtitles, unless they are already in English. A
                    selection will be translated into Estonian. If the transfer
                    of translated subtitles onto the DCP is not agreed with the
                    representative of the film, the translations will be shown
                    electronically.


                    All screening copies for all sections, if provided with any
                    subtitles, must have the subtitles on the active picture
                    area and not in the letterbox area. Dubbed language copies
                    are also refused.


                    The festival reserves the right to demand new DCP packages
                    free of charge in case of non-compatible DCPs, files are on
                    broken hard drives or other quality standards are not met.
                    These include wrongly placed or missing subtitles, or wrong
                    soundtracks.


                    Unencrypted DCPs are strongly preferred. In case of
                    encrypted DCPs, the festival requires one test KDM per film
                    free of charge for quality assurance and technical testing
                    for our test-screen or DKDM for laboratory testing. The
                    quality assurance purpose KDM or DKDM is requested to be
                    valid from the date the DCP arrives at the festival till 2
                    days after the festival.


                    The producer or film representative is requested to provide
                    appropriate screening KDMs valid from 3 days before the
                    start of the festival and 2 days after the festival, but in
                    minimum at least 72 hours prior to screenings, and 48 hours
                    after the screening. The cost of generating all KDMs will
                    also be the responsibility of the producers or
                    representatives of the film.


                    If the festival is provided with broken or wrongly assigned
                    KDMs, appropriate new KDMs must be provided free of charge
                    by the film submitter or representative. Quality assurance
                    purpose DKDM does not exempt from providing screening KDMs
                    if not agreed upon otherwise.


                    The festival supports 2K and 4K content. However, not all
                    screens have a 4K projecting capability. The festival
                    therefore cannot guarantee that all 4K films will be
                    screened in a 4K resolution.


                    The festival reserves the right to refuse and withdraw the
                    screening of the film from the competition or any other
                    section if all requirements are not followed.


                    Detailed technical guidelines will be available linked for
                    download along with the festival regulations on the festival
                    website from 1st of June 2020 and also provided along with
                    confirmation entry form.


                    Our festival’s technical team, dcinema@poff.ee, will happily
                    help with any queries for all confirmed films.

                    3.3 Technical requirements

                    Damaged or dubbed copies, non-compatible DCP’s and files on
                    broken hard drives are refused.


                    Requirements for video files:


                    Preferred file formats: Prores, DNxHD, h264

                    Minimum resolution: FullHD 1920x1080px

                    Framerate: 24 or 25fps;

                    on the picture area, not on the letterbox area (if present).

                    Requirements for DCPs:


                    DCP’s have to be provided either as Interop or SMPTE with
                    subtitle tracks of a clearly stated DCP format, aspect
                    ratio, subtitle and soundtrack information marked on the

                    copies are being sent, DCP’s have to be provided and shipped
                    on industry standard and protected hard drives.


                    Damaged or dubbed copies, non-compatible DCP’s and files on
                    broken hard drives are refused and the festival has the
                    right to demand new copies (as well as KDMs) free of charge
                    for damaged and non-working DCP packages.


                    Please note that:


                    The Festival supports 2K and 4K content in all screens.
                    However, not all screens have a 4K projector. The Festival
                    cannot guarantee that a 4K film will be screened in a 4K
                    resolution.

                    All screens support both Flat and Scope content.

                    The Festival requires all DCP’s to be in XYZ color space
                    encoded in JPEG2000. 

                    Countdown / start leaders must not be included.

                    Surround content should be submitted in 6 discrete channels
                    in the DCP.

                    Hard drives must be formatted in EXT2, EXT3.

                    The filmmaker or film representative has to provide
                    appropriate KDM’s for the original language soundtrack and
                    English subtitle tracks at least 72 hours prior to
                    screenings. If the festival is provided with broken or
                    wrongly assigned KDM’s, appropriate new KDM’s must be
                    provided free of charge by the film submitter or
                    representative to meet the minimum Festival requirements.


                    The festival reserves the right to demand screening copies
                    of competition films free of charge including alternative
                    keys to DCP copies or new DCP packages if quality standards

                    [film profile pages](https://poff.ee/en/search_film/) on the
                    PÖFF web site or directly on the film watching platform
                    [kino.poff.ee](kino.poff.ee) where you can see all the films
                    that are available for virtual viewing. There you can also
                    purchase the viewing rights. 

                    3.All virtual tickets can only be purchased at
                    [kino.poff.ee](kino.poff.ee) after creating an account
                    there. The ticket will also be sent to your email from our
                    address abi@poff.ee.


                    ###NB!


                    - Not all PÖFF films can be watched virtually.

                    - Films will become available for viewing in the online
                    environment only 3 hours after their physical premiere at
                    PÖFF.

                    - Bought ticket to virtual screeningns are valid for 48
                    hours - after you have bought the ticket to viertual
                    screening, you have 48 to start watching it. 

                    - After you have started watching the film, you have 30
                    hours to finish watching the film.  

                    - Sadly, due to technical restraints, the environment is
                    only in Estonian this year. But navigation is really easy
                    there, so hopefully, English-speakers can manage. All film
                    synopses and details can be found on the festival’s homepage
                    [poff.ee/en](poff.ee/en).

                    - As with regular screenings, the number of people who can
                    watch the virtual screenings is limited for every film.
                    These limits vary by film.


                    **How to watch virtual films?**


                    1.Log in to the environement [kino.poff.ee](kino.poff.ee).

                    2.All films you have purchased virtual access to can be
                    found in the subpage „Minu filmid“. If you have purchased a
                    ticket during presale, you will have to wait until 3 hours
                    have passed from the moment the film has begun its first
                    cinema screening at Black Nights to see it. 

                    3.To watch a film, press the button „Mängi“. To select
                    subtitles, press the CC icon on the right-hand side of the
                    player. Please note that many films that are in English
                    don’t have subtitles.

                    4.After purchasing the ticket, you can also go to the
                    virtual screening via the ticket confirmation email you get
                    from our account abi@poff.ee. Just open the email and click
                    the button „Vaata filmi“.

                    ## Turvajuhised ja nõuanded PÖFFi külastajatele


                    24. PÖFF tuleb koroonaviiruse tõttu teistsugune kui
                    varasemad – esimest korda saab filme vaadata nii kinodes kui
                    ka veebis. Teeme koostööd meditsiiniettevõtetega SYNLAB ja
                    Medicum ning perearstikeskusega Sinu Arst, samuti
                    konsulteerime Terviseametiga, et tagada kinokülastajatele
                    turvaline keskkond ning vältida koroonaviiruse levikut
                    festivaliga seotud üritustel.


                    Hoolime oma külastajatest väga ja soovime, et
                    festivalielamus oleks kõigile võimalikult meeldiv, mugav ja
                    turvaline. PÖFF kestab kaks ja pool nädalat ning selleks, et
                    jõuaksime koos teiega eduka lõpuni, oleme koostanud
                    allolevad juhised ja reeglid:


                    - Tungivalt soovitame osta piletid PÖFFi või Piletilevi
                    kodulehelt. Kodust pileti ostmine on lihtne, mugav ja
                    turvaline.

                    - Kogu festivaliinfo on leitav PÖFFi kodulehelt. Kui jääd
                    hätta, siis kirjuta info@poff.ee. Aitame Sind hea meelega.

                    - PÖFFi infopunkti palume festivali ajal külastada äärmisel
                    vajadusel. Meie kõigi huvides on see, et piletikassadesse ei
                    tekiks järjekordi. Järgime 2+2 reeglit. 

                    - Festivali üritustel ja -alal on maskide kandmine rangelt
                    soovituslik. Seansile võib tulla oma maskiga. Kui Sul maski
                    ei ole, saad selle festivalialale sisenedes meie
                    vabatahtlikult tasuta. 

                    - Kui Sa ostad pileti siiski PÖFFi kassast, ole valmis
                    selleks, et pilet isikustatakse. Selleks küsitakse Sinu
                    andmeid. Oma istekohti saalis muuta ei tohi. 

                    - Enne saali sisenemist võidakse valikuliselt mõõta
                    külastajate kehatemperatuuri. Juhul, kui tunned ennast
                    halvasti, palume Sul koju jääda ja vaadata meie filme
                    veebis.

                    - Festivalikinodes on desinfitseerimisvahendid, mida palume
                    kõigil kasutada.

                    - Seansside vaheajal puhastame ja desinfitseerime kõiki
                    kinosaale.

                    - Pärast seansi lõppu palume külastajaid saalist lahkuda
                    ridade kaupa, et uste juurde ei tekiks troppe.



                    Mis saab Sinu piletist, kui seanss või festival peaks
                    COVID-19 viiruse tõttu ära jääma?

                    - Loodame, et oled nõus vahetama ärajäänud seansi pileti
                    sama filmi järgmise seansi pileti vastu. Kui soovitud filmi
                    enam kinos ei ole, pakume võimalust vahetada pilet mõne muu
                    filmi pileti vastu või vaadata sama filmi veebi vahendusel,
                    kus näeb enamikku festivali filmidest.

                    - Soovijatel on võimalik ka ärajäänud seansi pileti eest
                    makstud raha PÖFFi toetuseks annetada. Piletitulu on meile
                    üks olulisemaid sissetulekuallikaid – eriti tänavu, kui
                    koroonaviirus on teinud filmitööstuse ja kultuuriürituste
                    elu väga keeruliseks. Annetamise puhul palume teavitada
                    festivali aadressil kassa@poff.ee. 

                    - Kui ükski nendest lahendustest ei sobi, ostame Sinu pileti
                    tagasi. 



                    Anname üheskoos endast parima, et 24. PÖFF oleks sama äge ja
                    turvaline elamus, nagu on olnud varasematel aastatel!
                contents_en: >-
                    Due to COVID-19 the 24th PÖFF will be different from
                    previous years as films will be screened both in cinemas and
                    on the web.


                    In cooperation with SYNLAB, Medicum and the Health Board of
                    Estonia, Black Nights Filmfestival is doing everything
                    possible to ensure a safe enviroment to all guests at
                    cinemas and other festival related events. 


                    We care about all our guests and wish to provide as safe,
                    comfortable and pleasant festival as possible.

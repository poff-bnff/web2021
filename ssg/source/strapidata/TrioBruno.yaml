                    from previous editions.


                    Directed by the Turkish director Ferzan Özpetek and shot in
                    Italy, The Goddess of Fortune sees a gay couple in crisis,
                    forced to babysit the children of their friends, while
                    emotionally reflecting on their relationship that is falling
                    apart.


                    The film will receive the miniature sculpture Kissing
                    Students, a copy of the original sculpture located on the
                    Tartu Town Hall Square where the screenings of Tartuff take
                    place.


                    The most popular film in terms of the number of viewers was
                    the Finnish film **The Force of Habit **that was seen by
                    around 700 people. The most popular film online was The
                    Final Portrait by director Stanley Tucci which gathered over
                    300 views.


                    Tartuff’s director **Kristiina Reidolv** commented: „We are
                    very grateful for the audience who followed all restrictions
                    and didn’t stress over the different organisation this year.
                    Big applause to our partners with who we managed to organise
                    over 30 events this year!“ she added.


                    The 15th edition of Tartuff ran from the 10th until the 15th
                    of August, having art as its central theme. The festival was
                    forced to implement a lot of restrictions due to the rising
                    number of COVID-19 cases in Tartu, including moving a part
                    of the programme online. Most of the festival films will
                    also be screened in the Film Museum in Tallinn from the 19th
                    until the 22nd of August.

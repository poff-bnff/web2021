have seen in the past two years, i can say that the authors too often lack a sense of film as a medium: the dance is there, but the film is not. it is forgotten that time, space, characters and what surrounds and creates them function differently on film than on stage.\n\nthe second problematic area is the clumsy integration of choreography into the world of film, which causes the language of dance on film to seem unjustified and not communicative enough. in those instances, dance does not say much and the reason a body moves a specific way remains uncertain.\n\nin the films that have been selected this year, the authors have created comprehensive worlds, despite the intricacy of the genre, and dance (in some cases movement as a whole) is a natural part of those worlds. these films are great examples of how space and a dancing body can form an eloquent whole, which in turn creates a spacious and voluminous world.\n\narolin raudva\n\nchoreographer-dancer\n\nfestival programmer for

puberty – i came across alfred döblin’s ‘berlin alexanderplatz’ during the course of my very un-academic, extremely personal literary journey, governed entirely by my own instinctive associations.“\n\nthis is how rainer werner fassbinder remembers his first encounter with the novel from which he created his own 15½-hour television adaptation in 1979. fassbinder biographer michael töteberg writes: “unlike döblin, fassbinder does not provide us with a portrait of a metropolis so much as a dramatisation of a series of interiors: he gauges emotional areas of conflict and concentrates entirely on the relationships between franz, reinhold and mieze, recognising in this constellation the scenario of his own life.\n\nin berlin alexanderplatz fassbinder was coming to terms with his own life. the large cast of characters gave him the opportunity to incorporate as actors all the people who had crossed his path in real life.” in terms of daringness and cinematic prowess, fassbinder’s döblin adaptation remains a unique achievement in german television history. fassbinder: “once i’d finished filming berlin alexanderplatz i said, o.k., now i‘ve mastered the craft.”\n\n

this constellation the scenario of his own life.\n\nin berlin alexanderplatz fassbinder was coming to terms with his own life. the large cast of characters gave him the opportunity to incorporate as

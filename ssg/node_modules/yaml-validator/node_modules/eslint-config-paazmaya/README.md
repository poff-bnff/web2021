# eslint-config-paazmaya

> Shared ESLint configuration between my projects since it is possible

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya)
[![devDependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/paazmaya/eslint-config-paazmaya?type=dev)

## Usage

Install via `npm` command line tool, along with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-paazmaya
```

Note that the minimum ESLint version supported is `6.7.0` due to the rule configuration, but the latest usually works best.

Change the `.eslintrc.json` to contain the configuration for the shared configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": "paazmaya"
}
```

For further details see [ESLint documentation for Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs).

For example, when [`babel-eslint` parser](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) would be needed:

```json
{
  "extends": "paazmaya",
  "parser": "babel-eslint"
}
```

The default configuration specifies [global variable environments](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-environments) as:

```js
env: {
  node: true,
  es6: true
}
```

The global variables themselves are [defined at `sindresorhus/globals`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/blob/master/globals.json).

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `10.13.0`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

Linting is done with [ESLint](http://eslint.org) and can be executed with `npm test`.
There should be no errors appearing after any JavaScript file changes.
